        is a Canadian multinational technology company focused on artificial intelligence
        for the enterprise, specializing in large language models. Cohere was founded
        in 2019 by Aidan Gomez, Ivan Zhang, and Nick Frosst, and is headquartered
        in Toronto and San Francisco, with offices in Palo Alto and London.\\n\\nIn
        2017, a team of researchers at Google Brain introduced the transformer machine
        learning architecture in \\\"Attention Is All You Need,\\\" which demonstrated
        state-of-the-art performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks.
        In 2019, Aiden Gomez, one of its co-authors, along with Nick Frosst, another
        researcher at Google Brain, founded Cohere with Ivan Zhang, with whom Gomez
        had done research at FOR.ai. All of the co-founders attended University of
        Toronto.\\n\\nGomez is the company's CEO. In December 2022, Martin Kon, the
        former CFO of YouTube, became president and COO.\\n\\nIn November 2021, Google
        Cloud announced that they would help power Cohere's platform using their robust
        infrastructure, and Cloud's TPUs would be used by Cohere for the development
        and deployment of their products.\\n\\nIn June 2022, Cohere launched Cohere
        For AI, a nonprofit research lab and community dedicated to contributing open-source,
        fundamental machine learning research. It is led by Sara Hooker, a former
        research scientist at Google Brain.\\n\\nIn December 2022, Cohere released
        a multilingual model for understanding text that would work with over 100
        languages, to help users search for documents by meaning instead of with keywords.
        This type of process was not previously widely available in languages other
        than English.\\n\\nOn June 13, 2023, Oracle announced a partnership with Cohere
        to provide generative AI services to help organizations automate end-to-end
        business processes. As a result, Cohere's technology is integrated into Oracle's
        business applications, including Oracle Fusion Cloud, Oracle NetSuite, and
        Oracle industry-specific applications. On July 18, 2023, McKinsey announced
        a collaboration with Cohere, to help organizations integrate generative AI
        into their operations. In 2023, Cohere collaborated with software company
        LivePerson to offer customized large language models for businesses.\\n\\nOn
        September 12, 2023, it was announced that Cohere had become one of 15 tech
        companies to agree to voluntary White House measures on testing, reporting,
        and research on the risks of AI. On September 27, 2023, it was announced that
        Cohere had also signed Canada's voluntary code of conduct for AI, to promote
        the responsible development and management of advanced generative AI systems.\\n\\nConsidered
        an alternative to OpenAI, Cohere is focused on generative AI for the enterprise,
        building technology that businesses can use to deploy chatbots, search engines,
        copywriting, summarization, and other AI-driven products. Cohere specializes
        in large language models: AI trained to digest text from an enterprises' internal
        data or publicly available sources like the internet to understand how to
        process and respond to prompts with increasing sophistication.\\n\\nThe Cohere
        platform is available through API as a managed service, through platforms
        such as Amazon SageMaker and Google's Vertex AI. It can be used for tasks
        such as writing copy, moderating content, classifying data, and extracting
        information. It is cloud agnostic and not tied to a particular cloud service.\\n\\nCohere's
        generative AI technology is embedded into several Oracle products, and its
        chat capabilities are embedded into Salesforce products.\\n\\nOn September
        7, 2021, Cohere announced that they had raised $40 million in Series A funding
        led by Index Ventures; Index Ventures partner Mike Volpi also joined Cohere's
        board. The round also included Radical Ventures, Section 32, and AI-experts
        Geoffrey Hinton, Fei-Fei Li, Pieter Abbeel, and Raquel Urtasun.\\n\\nIn February
        2022, Cohere announced they had raised $125 million in series B funding led
        by Tiger Global. In June 2023, Cohere raised an additional $270 million in
        series C funding from investors including Inovia Capital, Oracle, Salesforce,
        and Nvidia, at a valuation of $2.2 billion.\",\"timestamp\":\"2024-04-24T05:12:39\",\"title\":\"Cohere

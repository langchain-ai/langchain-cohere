        a funny statement! It seems to be a reference to a popular meme that originated
        from the Rick and Morty TV show. In the episode \"Pickle Rick\", Rick Sanchez
        turns himself into a pickle in a bizarre adventure. \n\nThe phrase \"I''m
        Pickle Rick\" has become a well-known catchphrase, often used humorously to
        suggest someone is in a ridiculous situation or has undergone a transformation
        of some kind. It''s great that you''re embracing your inner Pickle Rick!"}]},"finish_reason":"COMPLETE","usage":{"billed_units":{"input_tokens":4,"output_tokens":99},"tokens":{"input_tokens":70,"output_tokens":99}}}'

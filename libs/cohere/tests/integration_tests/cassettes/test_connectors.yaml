        for free\\n\\nDune 2 director Denis Villeneuve has waded into an increasingly
        controversial movie debate ahead of the release of his long-awaited movie
        sequel.\\n\\nThe filmmaker, whose credits include Arrival and Blade Runner
        2049, is busy promoting his new film, which is receiving acclaim from critics,
        including The Independent\u2019s Clarisse Loughrey, who awarded the film five
        stars out of five.\\n\\nDuring a new interview, he was challenged about the
        runtime of the Dune sequel, which stars Timoth\xE9e Chalamet and Zendaya,
        and is finally being released in March after being delayed due to the Hollywood
        strikes in 2023.\\n\\nIn the last 10 years, films have gotten longer and longer,
        with many regularly wondering on social media whether these increased lengths
        are necessary.\\n\\nRecent films to have been at the centre of such debate
        include Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer and Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers
        of the Flower Moon, which last for three hours and three hours, 30 minutes,
        respectidely.\\n\\nOne person who thinks this argument is silly is Villeneuve,
        whose Dune 2 has a runtime of two hours, 46 minutes.\\n\\nWhen asked about
        the runtime in a new interview, Villeneuve said that the film\u2019s distributor,
        Warner Bros Pictures, didn\u2019t tell him to cut the film down, saying \u201Cit
        was almost the opposite\u201D.\\n\\nBut Villeneuve is undeterred by complaints
        that blockbusters these days are too long, telling The Times: \u201CI trust
        the audience\u201D.\\n\\nDefending the new film\u2019s runtime, he said that
        the story, adapted from Frank Herbert\u2019s novel, is \u201Ctoo dense\u201D
        to tell in a more expedient manner.\\n\\nWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 days\\n\\nNew

        was the only way I could succeed,\u201Dhe said, adding: \u201CAlso, think
        of Oppenheimer. It is a three-hour, rated-R movie about nuclear physics that
        is mostly talking. But the public was young \u2013 that was the movie of the
        year by far for my kids.\u201D\\n\\nZendaya and Timoth\xE9e Chalamet in \u2018Dune:
        Part 2\u2019\\n\\n(Warner Bros Pictures)\\n\\nVillenueve argued that, while
        many people might be frustrated at lengthier runtimes, young people today
        actually want films to be longer.\\n\\nHe said: \u201CThere is a trend. The
        youth love to watch long movies because if they pay, they want to see something
        substantial. They are craving meaningful content.\u201D\\n\\nIt was found
        in 2023 that the average length of the top 10 highest-grossing movies in the
        US and Canada was two hours and 23 minutes \u2013 almost 30 minutes more than
        the average recorded in 2020.\\n\\nAddressing whether there will be a third
        Dune film, Villenueve said: \u201CThere is absolutely a desire to have a third
        one, but I don\u2019t want to rush it.\\n\\nHe said that when it comes to
        making another sequel, titled Dune: Messiah, he will take his time as \u201Cthe
        danger in Hollywood is that people get excited and only think about release
        dates, not quality\u201D.\\n\\nDune: Part 2 is being released in cinemas on

        chatting with Moviefone about Pugh\u2019s involvement in Part Two, Villeneuve
        explained that, while Pugh\u2019s Princess Irulan isn\u2019t a standout character
        right now, she will be featured heavily throughout Dune Messiah and likened
        her smaller to bigger roles as the same journey Zendaya went through in Part

        that will have inner strength and that will never be perceived as a victim.
        I wanted an actress that could convey only with the way she\u2019s listening,\u201D
        Villeneuve said, \u201CI wanted someone with a strong presence that the audience
        could see just in the way she was witnessing events or listening to other
        characters, that they feel her presence on her own journey, but she\u2019s
        more of a witness in this story.\u201D\\n\\n\u201COf course, if there\u2019s
        a Dune Messiah as we plan, she\u2019ll become one of the prominent characters
        of that whole series. I\u2019m doing a bit of what I did with Zendaya in the
        first movie. I introduced Chani in Dune and then she becomes one of the main
        characters in Part Two. I do the same with Florence, I just introduced her
        in Part Two and if there\u2019s a Dune Messiah, she becomes one of the main
        characters.\u201D\\n\\nPugh herself has confirmed that her role was meant

        Villeneuve responds to Christopher Nolan comparing the film to his \\\"favorite
        Star Wars movie\\\"\\n\\nBy Emily Murray published 26 February 2024\\n\\nExclusive
        | The filmmaker is very humbled by comparisons to The Empire Strikes Back\\n\\n(Image
        credit: Warner Bros)\\n\\nOnce the first reactions to the much anticipated
        sequel Dune 2 arrived online, one film that has been regularly cropping up
        in conversation is The Empire Strikes Back, the 1980 sci-fi classic that is
        often described as the best Star Wars film ever made.\\n\\nOppenheimer filmmaker
        Christopher Nolan was the first to compare the upcoming epic to Star Wars
        Episode 5 during an IMAX screening of the rerelease of Tenet, which featured
        an early preview of the second part of the big screen adaptation of Frank
        Herbert's beloved novel. In a clip shared by Raiders of the Lost Podcast,
        Nolan told Dune director Denis Villeneuve: \\\"For me, I don\u2019t think
        it says too much to say that if Dune: Part One was Star Wars, this to me is
        very much The Empire Strikes Back, which is my favorite of the Star Wars films.
        I just think it\u2019s an incredibly exciting expansion of all of the things
        you introduce in the first one.\\\"\\n\\nSince then the comparisons to the
        eighties classic have just kept coming in - our own reviewer Kevin Harley
        in the Total Film review of Dune: Part Two described the film as \\\"a sequel
        that ranks alongside The Dark Knight and The Empire Strikes Back\\\". High
        praise indeed!\\n\\nIt's something that Villeneuve didn't expect at all, being
        blown away by the response. Speaking to GamesRadar+ about Nolan's comment
        in particular, Villeneuve was very humbled, also adding that just like the
        Inception filmmaker it too is his favorite Star Wars film. He replied: \\\"It's
        a comparison that I would have never dared to do myself. I think it's a beautiful
        compliment because Empire Strikes Back is by far my favourite Star Wars movie.
        So, it\u2019s like, coming from Chris [Nolan], an incredible compliment.\\\"

        Part Two is a 2024 American epic science fiction film directed and produced
        by Denis Villeneuve, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts. The sequel
        to Dune (2021), it is the second of a two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel
        Dune by Frank Herbert. It follows Paul Atreides as he unites with the Fremen
        people of the desert planet Arrakis to wage war against House Harkonnen. Timoth\xE9e
        Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsg\xE5rd,
        Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem reprise their roles from the first film,
        with Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, L\xE9a Seydoux, and
        Souheila Yacoub joining the ensemble cast.\\n\\nDevelopment began after Legendary
        Entertainment acquired film and television rights for the Dune franchise in
        2016. Villeneuve signed on as director in 2017, intending to make a two-part
        adaptation of the novel due to its complexity. Production contracts were only
        secured for the first film, with the second film having to be greenlit based
        on the first's success. Villeneuve was concerned about the sequel's certainty
        after the first film had a simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release but
        Warner Bros. Pictures assured him the sequel would happen if it performed
        well on HBO Max. After the critical and commercial success of the first film,
        Warner Bros. and Legendary green-lit Dune: Part Two in October 2021. Principal
        photography took place in Budapest, Italy, Jordan and Abu Dhabi between July
        and December 2022.\\n\\nAfter being delayed from the November 2023 release
        date due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, the film had its world premiere
        at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square, London, on February 15, 2024, and opened
        in the United States on March 1. It was praised by critics and has grossed
        over $683 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024.
        A third film, based on Dune Messiah, is in development.\\n\\nFollowing the
        destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the daughter
        of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals that Paul Atreides may still
        be alive. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul and his pregnant
        mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach
        Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others
        see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the \\\"Outer World\\\"
        will bring prosperity to Arrakis.\\n\\nStilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's
        Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must replace her by drinking the
        Water of Life: a poison fatal for males and the untrained. Jessica transmutes
        the poison, surviving and inheriting the memories of every female ancestor
        in her lineage. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn
        daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus
        on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and
        her friend, Shishakli, believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the
        Fremen. However, she begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only
        intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.\\n\\nPaul and Chani
        fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language,
        becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm, and taking part in raids against
        Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names \\\"Usul\\\" and
        \\\"Muad'Dib\\\". Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen
        replaces his nephew, Glossu Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his psychotic,
        murderous younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit,
        is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to secure
        his genetic lineage.\\n\\nJessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists
        who believe in the prophecy. Paul stays North fearful that his visions of
        a holy war will occur if he goes south as a messiah. He reunites with Gurney
        Halleck, who leads him to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha
        attacks the northern Fremen\u2014including Sietch Tabr\u2014forcing Paul and
        the survivors to journey south; Shishakli remains and Feyd-Rautha kills her.
        Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers
        Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which
        awakens him. Paul now has a clearer vision of the past, present, and future.
        He sees an adult Alia on a water-filled Arrakis and learns that Jessica is
        the Baron's daughter. He also sees a singular path to victory among all possible
        futures.\\n\\nThe southern Fremen leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar to
        a death duel for leadership. He refuses, instead galvanizing the fundamentalists
        by showing that he can read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself
        the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis
        with Irulan, Mohiam, and his Sardaukar troops. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens,
        the Fremen launch an offensive using atomics and sandworms to overpower the
        Sardaukar forces. Paul murders the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage.
        Gurney intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban.\\n\\nPaul challenges Shaddam
        for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands Irulan's hand in marriage.
        Shaddam admits his involvement in the destruction of House Atreides. Previously
        summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to
        destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers
        to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a knife duel. Irulan agrees
        to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam
        kneels and kisses Paul's signet ring, thus surrendering. After the Great Houses
        reject Paul's ascendancy, he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet.
        As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and
        Alia reflect on the beginning of Muad'Dib's holy war. Chani refuses to bow
        to Paul and departs alone on a sandworm.\\n\\nTimoth\xE9e Chalamet as Paul
        Atreides, the exiled Duke of House Atreides who sides with the Fremen to overthrow
        the tyrannical House Harkonnen.\\n\\nZendaya as Chani, a young and rebellious
        Fremen warrior who is Paul's love interest\\n\\nRebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica,

        makes an uncredited cameo appearance as Alia Atreides, Paul's unborn sister
        who appears in his visions as well as communicating to Jessica while in her
        womb. Babs Olusanmokun and Roger Yuan reprise their roles from the first film
        as Jamis and Lieutenant Lanville, respectively. Stephen McKinley Henderson
        filmed scenes reprising his role as Thufir Hawat, while Tim Blake Nelson filmed
        scenes as an undisclosed character, but their scenes were not included in
        the final cut. Both were given a \\\"Special Thanks\\\" credit by Villeneuve.\\n\\nBy
        November 2016, Legendary Pictures had obtained the film and TV rights for
        the Dune franchise, based on the eponymous 1965 novel by Frank Herbert. Vice
        chair of worldwide production for Legendary Mary Parent began discussing with
        Denis Villeneuve about directing a film adaptation, quickly hiring him after
        realizing his passion for Dune. By February 2018, Villeneuve was confirmed
        to be hired as director, and intended to adapt the novel as a two-part film
        series. Villeneuve ultimately secured a two-film deal with Warner Bros. Pictures,
        in the same style as the two-part adaption of Stephen King's It in 2017 and
        2019. In January 2019, Joe Walker was confirmed to be serving as the film's
        editor. Other crew included Brad Riker as supervising art director, Patrice
        Vermette as production designer, Paul Lambert as visual effects supervisor,
        Gerd Nefzer as special effects supervisor, and Thomas Struthers as stunt coordinator.
        Dune: Part Two was produced by Villeneuve, Mary Parent, and Cale Boyter, with
        Tanya Lapointe, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, Thomas Tull, Jon
        Spaihts, Richard P. Rubinstein, John Harrison, and Herbert W. Gain serving
        as executive producers and Kevin J. Anderson as creative consultant. Legendary
        CEO Joshua Grode confirmed in April 2019 that they plan to make a sequel,
        adding that \\\"there's a logical place to stop the [first] movie before the
        book is over\\\".\\n\\nIn December 2020, Villeneuve stated that due to Warner
        Bros.' plan to release the film in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously,
        the first film could underperform financially, resulting in cancellation of
        the planned sequel. In an IMAX screening of the first film's first ten minutes,
        the title logo read Dune: Part One, lending credence to plans for the sequel.
        By August 2021, Villeneuve spoke more confidently about the chances of a sequel
        film, iterating his excitement to work with Timoth\xE9e Chalamet and Zendaya
        again, while stating Chani would have a bigger role in the sequel. Warner
        Bros. assured Villeneuve a sequel would be greenlit as long as the film performed
        well on HBO Max. Just days prior to the first film's release, Warner Bros.
        CEO Ann Sarnoff stated, \\\"Will we have a sequel to Dune? If you watch the
        movie you see how it ends. I think you pretty much know the answer to that.\\\"\\n\\nOn
        October 26, 2021, Legendary officially greenlit Dune: Part Two, with a spokesperson
        for the company stating, \\\"We would not have gotten to this point without
        the extraordinary vision of Denis and the amazing work of his talented crew,
        the writers, our stellar cast, our partners at Warner Bros., and of course
        the fans! Here's to more Dune.\\\" Production work had occurred back-to-back
        with the first film, as Villeneuve and his wife Lapointe immediately took
        a flight to Budapest in order to begin pre-production work. A key point of
        negotiation prior to greenlighting the sequel was assuring that the sequel
        would have an exclusive window where it would only be shown theatrically,
        with Legendary and Warner Bros. agreeing to give Dune: Part Two a 45-day window
        before it would be available through other channels. Villeneuve said this
        theatrical exclusivity was a \\\"non-negotiable condition\\\", and that \\\"the
        theatrical experience is at the very heart of the cinematic language for me\\\".
        With Dune: Part Two being greenlit, Villeneuve said that his primary concern
        was to complete the filming as soon as possible, with the earliest he expected
        to start in the last quarter of 2022. However, he noted that production would
        be expedited by the work already done for the first film.\\n\\nEric Roth was
        hired to co-write the screenplay in April 2017 for the Dune films, and Jon
        Spaihts was later confirmed to be co-writing the script alongside Roth and
        Villeneuve. Game of Thrones language creator David Peterson was confirmed
        to be developing languages for the film in April 2019. Villeneuve and Peterson
        had created the Chakobsa language, which was used by actors on set. In November
        2019, Spaihts stepped down as show-runner for Dune: Prophecy to focus on Dune:
        Part Two. In June 2020, Greig Fraser said, \\\"It's a fully formed story in
        itself with places to go. It's a fully standalone epic film that people will
        get a lot out of when they see it\\\". Between the release of Dune and the
        confirmation of Dune: Part Two, Villeneuve started working the script in a
        way that production could begin immediately once the film was greenlit. By
        February 2021, Roth created a full treatment for the sequel, with writing
        beginning that August. He confirmed that Feyd-Rautha would appear in the film,
        and stated he will be a \\\"very important character\\\". In March 2022, Villeneuve
        had mostly finished writing the screenplay. Craig Mazin and Roth wrote additional
        literary material for the film.\\n\\nVilleneuve stated that the film would
        continue directly from the first, and specifically described it as being the
        \\\"second part\\\". He described the film as being an \\\"epic war movie\\\",
        adding that while the first film was more \\\"contemplative\\\", the second
        would feature more action. Villeneuve sought to anchor the movie to the characters,
        primarily Paul and Chani. With the two featured in an \\\"epic love story\\\"
        between them, Villeneuve described them as the \\\"epicenter of the story\\\".
        Zendaya initially found difficulty in creating dialogue, commenting that \\\"It
        was funny trying to figure out in this futuristic space talk, like, how do
        they flirt?\\\" Chalamet also added that Paul would be heavily influenced
        by Chani, serving as his \\\"moral compass\\\". Additionally, Paul becomes
        deeply embedded in Fremen culture, developing a closer bond with Stilgar,
        who becomes his surrogate father figure and mentor, while tensions emerge
        between Chani and Lady Jessica, as Chani is aware that Jessica's schemes negatively
        impact the Fremen. The script ultimately conveys Chani as a nonbeliever of
        the prophecy and intended for its structure to first convey their romantic
        relationship from Paul's perspective, and eventually pivot to Chani's perspective
        as the audience realizes Paul's desire for power and insidious nature. He
        focused on Herbert's original intention to depict Paul as an antihero in Dune
        to becoming an eventual villain, and wrote the script with that in mind while
        also considering his future plans regarding Dune Messiah, particularly by
        modifying Chani's characterization as he felt that she eventually \\\"disappeared
        in Paul's shadows\\\" in the book. Feeling he had the \\\"benefit of time\\\"
        in doing so, Villeneuve decided to use all the elements of Paul's character
        arc and \\\"play them a bit differently\\\" in order to establish his eventual
        transformation into a villainous figure and becoming \\\"what he was trying
        to fight against\\\". He expanded the role of Chani and Lady Jessica from
        the novel, and interpreted Chani as being a critique of power. When envisioning
        the sandworm sequence, Villeneuve primarily relied upon his own drawings and
        storyboards, as he felt the book did not contain adequate descriptions. He
        later cited it as being one of his favorite scenes in the film. When writing
        Paul's character arc, he considered Paul as transforming from a \\\"humble\\\"
        figure to a \\\"dark messianic figure\\\", and took inspiration from Katsuhiro
        Otomo's Akira (1988) when designing the storyboards. Villeneuve felt the film's
        ending was more \\\"tragic\\\" than that of the book, feeling that it adequately
        resolved Paul's storyline across the Dune films while setting up his character
        arc for a potential third film based on Dune Messiah (1969).\\n\\nFollowing
        the first film, Baron Harkonnen is described as being heavily debilitated
        and reliant on being submerged in fluids, while focusing on choosing an heir:
        Glossu Rabban or Feyd-Rautha, both his nephews. Rabban was regarded as being
        a bad strategist, while Feyd-Rautha is shown to be clever and charismatic.
        Actor Austin Butler felt Feyd-Rautha's character served as \\\"flip sides
        of the same coin\\\" to Paul, as both had been involved in the Bene Gesserit's
        genetic breeding program; Butler opined Feyd-Rautha's upbringing on Giedi
        Prime and self-care for his body explained his arrogance. Meanwhile, Villeneuve
        noted his psychopathic personality and brutality similar to that of an animal
        contrasted his \\\"code of honors\\\" and reverence for fighters. Lady Jessica
        is also heavily traumatized by the death of Duke Leto, being compared to Paul
        as a \\\"survivor\\\" and strategizing to realize the ambitions of the Bene
        Gesserit, who aim to fulfill their prophecy to maximize human potential, disregarding
        morality and ethics. There is also additional focus on the political aspect,
        with Princess Irulan fearing that her father, Emperor Shaddam IV, will lose
        his throne due to his loss of influence over warring factions. During the
        sequence of Paul's consumption of the Water of Life, Villeneuve deliberately
        altered the timeframe to depict an adult Alia for a dramatic effect and to
        highlight Alia's unique birth. He and Spaihts decided to \\\"compress\\\"
        the time for both the sequence and Lady Jessica's pregnancy in order to establish
        more narrative tension. He also added that Lady Jessica's conversations with
        an embryonic Alia was unique as he felt it was \\\"fresh and original to have
        a character who is powerful and still a pregnant woman\\\" while also conveying
        how others perceive Alia as an \\\"abomination\\\". Like Chani and Lady Jessica,
        Villeneuve further developed Princess Irulan's character and motivations from
        the novel, with actress Florence Pugh noting her reserved nature and intelligence.\\n\\nIn
        March 2022, Pugh and Butler were reported to be in talks to star in the film
        as Princess Irulan and Harkonnen heir Feyd-Rautha, respectively. Butler was
        offered the role while having coffee with Villeneuve, without needing to audition.
        He trained for four months in Budapest, using a fitness regimen made by an
        ex-Navy SEALs member. Villeneuve described his performance as being a \\\"cross
        between a psychopath killer, an Olympic sword master, a snake, and Mick Jagger\\\"
        while Butler researched past cultures he felt \\\"bred brutality\\\" and took
        inspiration from various animals including sharks and snakes. Butler also
        said that he drew inspiration from Gary Oldman and Heath Ledger for his performance.
        He imitated Skarsg\xE5rd's voice as the Baron, as he felt that Feyd would
        be influenced by the Baron due to growing up with him. In May, Christopher
        Walken joined the cast as Shaddam IV. In June, L\xE9a Seydoux entered negotiations
        to join the cast as Lady Margot Fenring. In July, Souheila Yacoub joined the
        cast as Shishakli. In January 2023, Tim Blake Nelson was added to the cast
        in an undisclosed role. Attending the film's London premiere in February 2024,
        Anya Taylor-Joy confirmed that she had been cast in the film. Villeneuve was
        surprised that her role had been kept a secret for that long, noting it required
        \\\"so much work to keep that secret\\\". Her role had been revealed in a
        casting credit list for the film on Letterboxd.\\n\\nPre-shooting had commenced
        on July 4, 2022, at the Brion tomb in Altivole, Italy for two days. Principal
        photography was set to begin on July 21 in Budapest, Hungary, but began earlier
        on July 18. The film was entirely shot using Arri Alexa LF digital cameras,
        with new filming locations and sets being used \\\"to avoid repetition\\\".
        By October 2022, Chalamet had taken a break from filming in order to attend
        the premiere of Bones and All (2022). The production team managed to shoot
        during the partial solar eclipse of October 25, and used the footage for the
        opening fight scene between Harkonnen and Fremen soldiers. By the next month,
        production moved to Abu Dhabi, with Pugh also finishing her scenes in the
        same month. Certain scenes set at dawn had to be filmed across three days
        to take advantage of the golden hour. A special unit of production filmed
        scenes with Taylor-Joy in Namibia, the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa.
        Filming wrapped on December 12, 2022. Due to the delays, Villeneuve was able
        to make a film transfer for projection using the IMAX 70 mm and conventional
        70 mm film formats.\\n\\nPugh delivered Princess Irulan's opening narration
        during her first day of filming and for overall production. Villeneuve and
        cinematographer Greig Fraser had filmed Feyd-Rautha's gladiator sequence with
        specially designed black-and-white infrared cameras. They wanted the Harkonnens
        to cheer and stomp rather than applaud, and designed over 30 sections for
        spectators in the arena. Butler spent his first week on set filming the scene,
        during which the set had very high temperatures that caused some people to
        faint. He also improvised his kiss scene with the Baron. For romantic scenes
        between Paul and Chani, the scenes primarily filmed in remote locations in
        Jordan during the golden hour. The scenes were often filmed as quickly as
        possible, with only a one-hour window being available. The scene of Paul's
        sandworm ride was filmed practically on a production unit separate from the
        main one, being led by producer Tanya Lapointe and a special team. Chalamet
        filmed his scenes on a platform meant to imitate a portion of the sandworm,
        with gripping devices serving as the reference for the Fremen hooks. An industrial
        fan blew sand on set to emulate the desert climate. Chalamet estimated the
        scene took over three months to film, with individual shoots occurring over
        a span of 20\u201330 minutes. As the actual sandworm was not built and there
        were no reference shots, the production team designed a small portion of the
        worm on set and the actors had to physically visualize and imitate riding
        the sandworm. Butler and Chalamet had separately trained with a Kali instructor
        in Los Angeles for the climactic battle between Paul and Feyd-Rautha. They
        were excited to do the scene, and immediately began practicing once they later
        met in Budapest. They performed the scene by themselves, including for wide
        camera shots, while Chalamet delivers the monologue entirely in Chakobsa.
        Ferguson had cited Lady Jessica undergoing the Reverend Mother process as
        her favorite scene, working with contortionists for the scene and comparing
        it to an Exorcist film.\\n\\nHans Zimmer returned to compose the film's score
        after doing so for the previous film. Zimmer had composed over 90 minutes
        of music prior to the announcement of the film to help give Villeneuve inspiration
        when writing. Two singles were released on February 15, 2024, by WaterTower
        Music, titled \\\"A Time of Quiet Between the Storms\\\" and \\\"Harvester
        Attack\\\". The full soundtrack album was released on February 23.\\n\\nA
        teaser trailer for Dune: Part Two was presented during the Warner Bros. panel
        at CinemaCon on April 27, 2023. First-look footage of the cast in-character
        were released online, alongside a teaser poster, on May 2, 2023. The trailer
        was released to the public the following day. Variety called it \\\"breathtaking\\\";
        GQ hailed the shots of Paul riding a sandworm as \\\"the standout sequence\\\";
        and Fangoria remarked \\\"If you're not excited for this one, we dunno what
        to tell you\\\". Chalamet and Zendaya later discussed and promoted the film
        at a Warner Bros. presentation at CineEurope on June 21.\\n\\nA second trailer
        was released on June 29, 2023. Chris Evangelista of Film was excited about
        the appearance of Christopher Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV. Ben Travis of
        Empire praised the \\\"seismic\\\" and \\\"astounding, none-more-eye-boggling\\\"
        imagery, feeling the scope to be \\\"particularly expansive\\\" and noted
        the monochromatic footage depicting Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha while calling
        the footage of Christopher Walken's appearance \\\"impactful\\\". Joshua Rivera
        of Polygon opined \\\"The trailer, simply put, rocks\\\" and enjoyed the footage
        present.\\n\\nThe film was promoted during the December 2023 CCXP with Chalamet,
        Zendaya, Pugh, Butler, and Villeneuve, where over 10 minutes of footage was
        released. Additional footage from Dune: Part Two was shown during a limited
        IMAX theatrical re-release of Christopher Nolan's Tenet (2020), as part of
        Warner Bros.' celebration for the former film's release.\\n\\nWarner Bros.
        and Legendary Pictures partnered with Xbox to provide an immersive content
        suite related to the film, and visual designs inspired by the film being featured
        on a floating controller, Xbox Series X, and a console holder. Microsoft Flight
        Simulator also included an expansion pack allowing players to explore Arrakis
        and pilot the Royal Atreides Ornithopter. In November 2023, the Sardaukar
        were added to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022) in a collaboration pack.
        A month later, Paul and Feyd-Rautha were added as playable operators to its
        sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023), with an additional Harkonnen
        soldier skin being announced in March 2024. In September 2023, McFarlane Toys
        announced a new line of 7-inch figures modeled after characters from the sequel
        film. Legendary Comics will release Dune: Part Two \u2013 The Official Movie
        Graphic Novel with the help of Kickstarter in the same way the previous adaptation
        was published.\\n\\nResearch conducted by Nikolaj Mathies, CEO of Vievo Media,
        said the promotional campaign for the film on TikTok included 117 posts over
        a year leading up to its release, an increase from the first film's 108. Messages
        directly from the cast comprised 24% of the content, with videos featuring
        Zendaya and Chalamet generating significantly higher viewership. Red carpet
        content was prioritized to appeal to female audiences, a tactic that contributed
        to an estimated $2 million increase in the opening box office. According to
        the marketing research company FanBox, 57% of TikTok users are female and
        hashtags such as #zendaya have garnered billions of views, leading the core
        audience for Dune to grow significantly, with a 67.5% increase overall from
        2.6 million to 8 million and an 84% increase among \\\"superfans\\\".\\n\\nIn
        January 2024, images of a forthcoming Dune-themed popcorn bucket from AMC
        Theatres went viral and became an Internet meme after its sandworm-inspired
        design was compared to an artificial vagina.\\n\\nReactions to the bucket
        received millions of views on the social network TikTok, and much of Dune:
        Part Two's main cast and its director were specifically asked to comment on
        it. Jokes about it were featured on US late night television, including a
        musical sketch on Saturday Night Live featuring Marcello Hernandez, Ayo Edebiri,
        Devon Walker, and Bowen Yang.\\n\\nGriffin Newman in The New York Times chalked
        up the bucket's appeal to the \\\"magic alchemy\\\" that results from an object
        that so many people become \\\"perversely fascinated\\\" by. The product was
        one of several popcorn buckets AMC had designed and released alongside recent
        films, including character heads for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and
        \\\"burn books\\\" for Mean Girls.\\n\\nTwo months after Dune: Part Two's
        release, AMC's chief content officer stated that \\\"we would have never created
        [the bucket] knowing it would be celebrated or mocked\\\", but added that
        they would continue to create collectible popcorn buckets for other films.
        At that time, the popcorn buckets were still selling for as high as $100 on
        the auction website eBay.\\n\\nDune: Part Two was originally scheduled to
        be released on October 20, 2023, but was delayed to November 17, 2023, before
        moving forward two weeks to November 3, 2023, to adjust to changes in release
        schedules from other studios. It was later postponed by over four months to
        March 15, 2024, due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. After the strikes
        were resolved, the film moved once more up two weeks to March 1, 2024.\\n\\nFollowing
        the success of Oppenheimer (2023) in the format, Dune: Part Two was released
        in the IMAX 15-perforation 70 mm format to twelve venues worldwide, and in
        standard 5-perforation 70mm format to 38 venues worldwide.\\n\\nA red carpet
        event was hosted in the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City on February 6, 2024.
        Dune: Part Two's world premiere was held at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in
        London on February 15.\\n\\nOn January 16, 2024, the film was shown to a dying
        man in a palliative care home in the Canadian city of Saguenay, in Denis Villeneuve's
        native province of Quebec. The man had expressed a wish to see Dune: Part
        Two before his death. Jos\xE9e Gagnon, the cofounder of a company aiming to
        accompany people at the end of life, relayed his wish to Villeneuve and Tanya
        Lapointe, his partner and one of the film's producers, through a viral call-out
        on Facebook. According to Gagnon, Villeneuve and Lapointe \\\"were very touched\\\".
        The pair initially offered to invite the man to see Dune: Part Two in Los
        Angeles or Montreal, but since he was too weak to travel, Villeneuve eventually
        decided to send one of his assistants directly to Saguenay with his private
        laptop. The film was screened in a room of the care facility, where everyone
        was required to hand in their cellphones and sign waivers. The man was in
        too much pain to watch it the entire film and stopped halfway through. He
        eventually died on January 25. This act, which the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
        referred to as the actual \\\"world premiere\\\" of the film, was publicly
        disclosed after its theatrical release.\\n\\nThe film will be released digitally
        on April 16, 2024 and on Blu-ray, DVD and Ultra HD Blu-ray on May 14, 2024,
        by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.\\n\\nAs of April 13, 2024, Dune: Part
        Two has grossed $269 million in the United States and Canada and $400.4 million
        in other territories, for a worldwide total of $669.4 million. The Hollywood
        Reporter had estimated that the film would break-even after grossing around
        $500 million.\\n\\nIn the United States and Canada, the film's advanced ticket
        sales surpassed those of Oppenheimer, and it was projected to gross $65\u201380
        million from 4,050 theaters in its opening weekend. It was also expected to
        gross $85\u201390 million from 71 international markets, for a worldwide debut
        of around $170 million. The film made $32.2 million on its first day, including
        $12 million from previews on February 25 and 29; IMAX screenings made up $4.5
        million (38%) of the early totals. It went on to debut to $82.5 million, doubling
        the first film's $41 million opening weekend; IMAX screenings made up $18.5
        million (23%) of the total, a record for a March release. According to Jeff
        Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., it was \\\"much
        higher than any of us could predict\\\", especially for \\\"a genre that is
        a hard nut to crack\\\". In its second weekend the film made $46 million (a
        44% drop), finishing second behind newcomer Kung Fu Panda 4. It also surpassed
        the entire domestic gross of the first film ($108 million) in just seven days.
        The film made $28.5 million in its third weekend and $17.6 million in its
        fourth, remaining in second both times. It also became Timoth\xE9e Chalamet's
        highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing Wonka.\\n\\nOutside the US and
        Canada, the film grossed $100.02 million in its opening weekend from 71 markets.
        In its second weekend, the sci-fi epic added $81 million from 72 international
        markets, including a $20 million opening in China. Dune: Part Two continued
        to hold well, grossing $51.2 million and $30.7 million in its third and fourth
        weekends respectively. As of April 7, 2024, the highest grossing markets were
        China ($47.7 million), United Kingdom ($46.3 million), Germany ($37.6 million),
        France ($36.4 million) and Australia ($21.1 million).\\n\\nThe film \\\"largely
        received rave reviews from critics\\\", and was praised for its visual effects
        and cast performances. Some reviews considered it one of the best science
        fiction films of all time. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes,
        93% of 413 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10.
        The website's consensus reads: \\\"Visually thrilling and narratively epic,
        Dune: Part Two continues Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of the beloved sci-fi
        series in spectacular form.\\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average,
        assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating
        \\\"generally favorable\\\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave
        the film an average grade of \\\"A\\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled
        by PostTrak gave it a 94% overall positive score, with 80% saying they would
        definitely recommend it.\\n\\nThe Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin awarded
        the film four stars out of five and praised its visuals: \\\"Dune's loose-endedness
        is one of its best qualities: finding out what happens is secondary to just
        seeing it unfold.\\\" Peter Bradshaw, chief film critic for The Guardian,
        awarded the film four stars out of five, writing \\\"Denis Villeneuve's monumental
        adaptation expands its extraordinary world of shimmering strangeness. It's
        impossible to imagine anyone doing it better.\\\" Richard Roeper, writing
        for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film three stars out of four, praising
        the technical and narrative aspects, saying, \\\"Even as we marvel at the
        stunning and immersive and Oscar-level cinematography, editing, score, visual
        effects, production design and sound in Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two,
        we're reminded at every turn that this is an absolutely bat-bleep [sic] crazy
        story.\\\"\\n\\nFilmmaker Steven Spielberg praised the film, calling it \\\"one
        of the most brilliant science fiction films I have ever seen,\\\" while further
        noting that \\\"it's also filled with deeply, deeply drawn characters ...
        Yet the dialogue is very sparse when you look at it proportionately to the
        running time of the film. It's such cinema. The shots are so painterly, yet
        there's not an angle or single setup that's pretentious.\\\"\\n\\nOther reviews
        were more mixed in their judgement. In The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia Gyarkye
        praised the film's technical aspects and performances, but found it failed
        to fully adapt the book's nuance on themes such as imperialism. Nicholas Barber
        wrote for the BBC that the film is \\\"one of the most jaw-droppingly weird
        pieces of art-house psychedelia ever to come from a major studio\\\", finding
        the film's grand scale made up for its issues. At the more negative end, Noah
        Berlatsky writing for CNN judged that the film had failed to \\\"present an
        effective anti-colonial vision\\\" by still being centred around Paul's destiny
        despite an increased voice of opposition from Chani.\\n\\nSome commentators
        have criticised the film for failing to adequately deal with the original
        book's Middle East and North Africa (MENA) influences or otherwise incorporate
        enough representation from the region. Furvah Shah, writing for the UK edition
        of Cosmopolitan, said she \\\"felt frustrated as a Muslim viewer\\\", criticising
        the film for a lack of MENA casting amongst the leads despite the use of the
        region's culture and superficial use of Islam. The New Arab's Hannah Flint
        also criticized the use of Arab and Islamic cultural items and lack of MENA
        casting, though did praise that of Swiss-Tunisian actress Souheila Yacoub
        as a \\\"win for Arab representation\\\". Steven D. Greydanus, in U.S. Catholic,
        gives a contrasting view of the film's religious inspirations, noting that
        the film draws from a number of Abrahamic religions for the purpose of critiquing
        faith itself, while also noting the \\\"spiritualization of ecological concerns\\\"
        through the Fremen.\\n\\nThe trailer for Dune: Part Two received nominations
        for Best Fantasy Adventure and the Don LaFontaine Award for Best Voice Over
        at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards. The film was nominated for Most Anticipated
        Film at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.\\n\\nVilleneuve
        has repeatedly expressed interest in making a third film based on Dune Messiah,
        the second novel in the series, adding that the possibility for the film depended
        on the success of Dune: Part Two. Spaihts also reiterated in March 2022 that
        Villeneuve had plans for a third film as well as the television spin-off series
        Dune: Prophecy. In August 2023, Villeneuve said the third film would serve
        as the conclusion of a trilogy. Villeneuve began developing a script for the
        third film in 2023. In February 2024, Villeneuve said the script was \\\"almost
        finished\\\" but also said he \\\"[does not] want to rush it\\\", citing Hollywood's
        tendency of focusing on release dates over a film's overall quality, and adding,
        \\\"I want to make sure that if we go back there a third time I want it to
        be good and I want it to be even better than Part Two\\\". Villeneuve also
        considered waiting a few years for Chalamet to grow older, given that Dune
        Messiah is set 12 years after the events of the original book.\\n\\nAhead
        of Dune: Part Two's release, Zimmer revealed he was already writing music
        for a third film after Villeneuve came in and \\\"wordlessly\\\" put a copy
        of Dune Messiah on his desk. In April 2024, it was reported that Villeneuve
        and Legendary had officially begun development on the third film.\\n\\nList

        like LSD or something like that.\u201D\\n\\n Posted March 28, 2024, 10:07
        p.m.\\n\\nDune: Part Two director Denis Villeneuve recently revealed his approach
        to delivering the sequel to complete the story from Frank Herbert's Dune book.
        Villeneuve, who also directed Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, said that he
        tried his best to stay from \u201Cfantasy\u201D elements while staying as
        true as possible to the source material. Here\u2019s what he revealed.\\n\\nFrank
        Herbert's Dune novel came out in 1965 and features not only themes related
        to politics, power, and religion, but also offers fantasy elements such as
        advanced technology, mythical creatures and prophecies, and even some form
        of magic.\\n\\nHow Dune depicted sci-fi elements\\n\\nVilleneuve was recently
        on the Director's Cut podcast with Steven Spielberg where he said, \u201CI
        tried my best to be away from fantasy, meaning that I tried in that context
        to try to be as plausible [as possible]. You can almost explain everything,
        apart from the fact that his super powerful reaction to that substance that
        is the spice\u2026\u201D\\n\\nAlso Read: Dune: Awakening Is Looking Supremely
        Cool \u2013 As It Was Written\\n\\nHe continued to add that he loves the idea
        that Paul Atredies, played by Timoth\xE9e Chalamet, is not a \u201Cmessianic
        figure, really. It\u2019s just that the context and the other people perceive
        him, and all the power they put on him.\u201D The director also added that
        Paul does not have \u201Cany magic power, apart from being uber-sensitive
        to that substance. Spice is almost like LSD or something like that.\u201D\\n\\nSince
        the director\u2019s vision deals with a pragmatic approach, rather than focusing
        on supernatural aspects, the cinematography also reflects the resistance to
        rely overly on CGI as well to show the world of Arrakis, except the Sandworms
        of course.\\n\\nSpeaking of cinematography, the movie\u2019s cinematographer
        Greg Fraizer recently spoke about how the world of Arrakis came to life with
        the help of Unreal Engine, a powerful 3D computer graphics engine used for
        many popular games such as Fortnite, Tekken 8, and more. Frazier said that
        Unreal Engine was really helpful in the pre-production phase and that it arrived
        as a \u201Cgodsend\u201D during the pre-production phase to \u201Cspeed up
        the process.\u201D\\n\\nContinue Reading: Dune: Part 2 Closes in on $500 Million

        especially surrounding Lady Jessica and unborn Alia Atreides.\\n\\nAlia's
        character in the film diverges significantly from the novel, with a condensed
        timeline and innovative twist involving her communication with Jessica as
        an embryo.\\n\\nThe adaptation not only preserves the essence of Herbert's
        novel but also introduces fresh elements that enhance the cinematic experience,
        showcasing the challenges and rewards of adapting literary works.\\n\\nWARNING!
        This article contains Dune: Part Two major spoilers.Dune: Part Two emerges
        as a testament to the art of adaptation, charting a course that both honors
        and deviates from Frank Herbert's original masterpiece. With Denis Villeneuve
        at the helm, the film boldly reimagines crucial story elements, especially
        the depiction of Lady Jessica, portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson, and the unborn
        Alia Atreides, portrayed by Anya Taylor-Joy.\\n\\nThis creative decision was
        born out of a desire to amplify the tension surrounding Paul Atreides', played
        by Timoth\xE9e Chalamet, journey and to enhance Jessica's role during her
        pregnancy. Villeneuve regarded this as a moment to uncover a unique dimension
        of the story that hadn't been shown on screen before, particularly from a
        science fiction perspective, per Entertainment Weekly. The director's choice
        to have Jessica converse with her unborn child serves as a powerful illustration
        of the Water of Life's transformative power and offers a deeper insight into
        the concept of Alia as an \\\"abomination\\\" in the eyes of the Bene Gesserit.
        Villeneuve explained:\\n\\n\\\"I was deeply happy with the fact that Anya
        accepted this challenge of playing a ghost and a secret. I cannot believe
        that we kept the secret that long. It required so much work to keep that secret.
        Everybody signed with their blood.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It came out of screenwriting
        discussions with Jon [Spaihts], when we were trying to figure out how to increase
        tension and create more momentum in the story. To put more pressure on Paul,
        we decided to compress time. We had this idea that we could create the feeling
        of the progression of time through Jessica's pregnancy. I thought this was
        really fresh and original to have a character who is pregnant and still a
        powerful woman, a central figure of the story. I don't remember having seen
        that, especially in a sci-fi movie, and it gave me the opportunity to develop
        ideas that were in the book. Having her talk to her fetus was a way to illustrate
        the power of the Water of Life, this substance that gives you access to the
        past lives of previous Reverend Mothers. It was a way to more precisely express
        how Alia becomes this abomination.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When we had this idea, it
        was like an epiphany for me. It was one of the final bricks of the screenplay.
        I don't know how the fans will react, because it's a strong curve that we
        took, but I felt that it was very close to the spirit of the book. I'm very
        happy with this idea.\\\"\\n\\nDune: Part Two: Burning Questions We Want Answered
        in the Sequel From Paul's vague visions to the Emperor's true motives, Dune:
        Part Two should resolve many unanswered questions.\\n\\nIn Herbert's novel,
        Jessica's ingestion of the Water of Life during her pregnancy endows Alia
        with the consciousness and abilities of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. However,
        the film adaptation opts for a different narrative path. Due to a more condensed
        timeline, Alia's birth does not occur within the film's timeframe. Instead,
        she is introduced through a vision, and an innovative twist sees Jessica communicating
        with Alia as an embryo, with Taylor-Joy lending her voice to the role.\\n\\nDune:
        Part Two Reimagines Key Plot Points for the Screen\\n\\nThe film's adaptation
        of Alia's character represents one of its most significant departures from
        the book. In the novel, Alia is a four-year-old with the intellect and demeanor
        of a Reverend Mother. Translating this to the screen would have presented
        considerable challenges. By having Taylor-Joy voice Alia as an embryo and
        appear in a vision, the film maintains her central role in the narrative while
        effectively showcasing the Water of Life's formidable power.\\n\\nAdditionally,
        the adaptation makes a crucial change to a key plot point. Instead of Alia,
        it is Paul who eliminates Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, played by Stellan Skarsg\xE5rd,
        a modification that aligns with Paul's character arc and the film's climax.
        Alia's involvement in revealing their Harkonnen heritage in a vision ensures
        her continued relevance to the story and the Baron's eventual downfall.\\n\\nDune:
        Part Two exemplifies the challenges and rewards of adapting a beloved literary
        work for the screen. Villeneuve's thoughtful alterations not only preserve
        the essence of Herbert's novel but also introduce fresh elements that enhance
        the cinematic experience. As the story of Arrakis unfolds, this adaptation
        reminds us that careful and creative changes can enrich and deepen the storytelling
        experience.\\n\\nTimothee Chalamet , Zendaya Coleman , Stellan Skarsg\xE5rd\\n\\nDune

        and one of his friends watched the film on the screen of Villeneuve\u2019s
        laptop \u2014 which the director\u2019s assistant had flown in that day. Secrecy
        was paramount \u2014 those involved signed nondisclosure agreements and put
        away their phones to avoid leaks.\\n\\nGetting the film to the man was a \u201Crace
        against the clock,\u201D Jos\xE9e Gagnon, whose charity made the moment happen,
        told The Washington Post.\\n\\nGagnon, founder of Canadian charity L\u2019Avant,
        which is focused on helping people at the end of their lives realize their
        dreams, detailed the story in a Monday interview and in a recent Facebook
        post. Gagnon said she was able to speak freely after the film was publicly
        released, but declined to reveal the man\u2019s identity to protect his privacy.\\n\\nThe
        race began in January, when L\u2019Avant put out a call on Facebook for anyone
        who could reach Villeneuve.\\n\\n\u201CI would like to make some magic for
        a person at the end of their life,\u201D said the charity\u2019s post. Time
        was of the essence, the post said, because the person had only \u201Ca few
        more weeks left.\u201D The post did not provide more details about the request
        \u2014 but shortly thereafter, the charity posted that its request had reached
        Villeneuve.\\n\\nA representative for Villeneuve declined to comment Monday.
        Gagnon, in a Facebook post on Friday, said that Villeneuve and his wife, Tanya
        Lapointe, an executive producer of \u201CDune: Part Two,\u201D were \u201Cextremely
        touched by this man\u2019s last wish\u201D when they spoke.\\n\\n\u201CThey
        told me, \u2018It\u2019s precisely for him that we make films,\u2019\u201D
        she recounted.\\n\\nSo they got to work. Villeneuve and his wife initially
        wanted to fly the man to Montreal or Los Angeles so he could watch the film,
        Gagnon said in her post and in an interview with Radio-Canada. But, she said
        in her post, it was \u201Cimpossible\u201D because he was \u201Ctoo weak.\u201D\\n\\n\u201CTime
        was passing. The dying man was dying,\u201D she wrote.\\n\\nThen, a breakthrough:
        On Jan. 16, Villeneuve\u2019s assistant flew to Quebec with the director\u2019s
        laptop, and took it to the palliative care center about 130 miles north of
        Quebec City, Gagnon said.\\n\\nShare this articleShare\\n\\nThe man didn\u2019t
        speak English and had to watch the film with French subtitles, Gagnon told
        The Post. He \u201Cwas so weak that we thought he might die while watching
        the film,\u201D she wrote on Facebook.\\n\\nThe man ultimately was not able
        to watch the full 2 hours and 46 minutes of the film. He was in pain and saw
        only about half of it before he had to stop, Gagnon told The Post. He died
        a few days later.\\n\\nHe died \u201Ctaking the secret of the film with him,\u201D
        Gagnon said in her post.\\n\\nGagnon told Radio-Canada\u2019s \u201CPlace
        publique\u201D program that some of those involved in the project felt it
        was a \u201Cfailure\u201D because the man never got to see the ending of the
        film.\\n\\nBut she felt differently. \u201CI said: \u2018You don\u2019t understand,
        it\u2019s extraordinary what this man went through. The ending of a film,
        when you\u2019re going to die, it doesn\u2019t mean anything. \u2026 All this
        existed for him.\u2019\u201D\\n\\nMissing the ending \u201Cdidn\u2019t matter,\u201D
        she said. The man had a \u201Cvery difficult start to life\u201D and saw people
        around him \u2014 and those who didn\u2019t know him \u2014 work to carry
        out his last wish. And that, she wrote, \u201Cwas worth all the gold in the
        world.\u201D\\n\\nNow, she has just one message: \u201CPeople have to continue
        to believe that everything is possible when it is done with heart,\u201D she
        told The Post.\\n\\nWoman\u2019s dying wish: A funeral flash mob to \u2018Another
        One Bites the Dust\u2019\\n\\nFollowing its release, \u201CDune: Part Two\u201D
        has turned into a hit with critics and viewers, collecting an estimated $182.5
        million across 72 markets in its opening weekend.\\n\\nGagnon said in the
        post that she still hadn\u2019t seen \u201CDune: Part Two,\u201D but she planned
        to soon. \u201CI\u2019ll smile like an idiot the whole time thinking about

        on March 2, 2024\\n\\nWarning: This article contains spoilers about Dune:
        Part Two.\\n\\nEven with two movies that are each longer than two hours, director
        Denis Villeneuve wasn\u2019t able to bring every single element of Frank Herbert\u2019s
        Dune to the screen. When speaking with EW for our recent cover story on Dune:
        Part Two, the filmmaker revealed the hardest cut he had to make from the source
        material.\\n\\n\\\"When you adapt, there's always some kind of violence toward
        the original material,\\\" Villeneuve tells Entertainment Weekly. \\\"You
        have to change things, you have to bend, you have to make painful choices.\\\"\\n\\nDenis
        Villeneuve and Javier Bardem on the set of 'Dune: Part Two'.\\n\\nDune: Part
        Two is not afraid to make changes to Herbert's original story. The Fremen
        warrior Chani (Zendaya), for example, is much more independent in the new
        film than she is in the book. She expresses open opposition to the ascension
        of her lover Paul Atreides (Timoth\xE9e Chalamet) to the status of Fremen
        messiah, rather than loyally standing by her man. Paul\u2019s sister Alia
        only appears as a fetus (albeit one awakened to universal consciousness) and
        briefly as a vision of her older self in a dream, portrayed by Anya Taylor-Joy.\\n\\nBut
        several characters who play significant roles in the back half of Herbert\u2019s
        Dune don\u2019t appear on screen in Dune: Part Two at all. Although Lea Seydoux
        shows up as Lady Margot Fenring, an agent of the Bene Gesserit, we never meet
        her husband, Count Fenring, who in the book is a powerful friend of the Emperor
        (Christopher Walken). Viewers also don\u2019t see any more from Paul\u2019s
        mentor Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson) in Villeneuve's second film,
        even though in the book he survives the massacre of House Atreides by House
        Harkonnen. Henderson was listed among the film's cast on Wikipedia before
        its release because many assumed he would play as large a role in the film
        as he does in the book \u2014 but alas.\\n\\n\\\"One of the most painful choices
        for me on this one was Thufir Hawat,\\\" Villeneuve admits. \\\"He's a character
        I absolutely love, but I decided right at the beginning that I was making
        a Bene Gesserit adaptation. That meant that Mentats are not as present as
        they should be, but it's the nature of the adaptation.\\\"\\n\\nStephen McKinley
        Henderson in 'Dune'.\\n\\nWarner Bros. Pictures\\n\\nMentats are, essentially,
        human computers. In the world of Dune, artificial intelligence has long since
        been destroyed and outlawed in a campaign known as the Butlerian Jihad. There
        are two replacements for the functions of thinking machines. One is the spice
        melange, which can psychedelically expand one's mind and allow navigators
        from the Spacing Guild to chart spaceship routes over long distances without
        crashing into each other. The other is Mentats, humans trained from a young
        age to perform high-level mathematic and strategic calculations. All of the
        noble Great Houses in the Dune universe have their own Mentat, like Maesters
        in Game of Thrones.\\n\\nHawat was the Mentat for House Atreides. In 2021's
        Dune, we saw his powers in action when Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) wondered
        aloud how much money was spent on the imperial delegation announcing his new
        stewardship of Arrakis; Hawat's eyes rolled back into his head as he ran the
        numbers. Viewers also met Piter de Vries (David Dastmalchian), the much creepier
        Mentat for House Harkonnen. Piter was killed during Duke Leto's suicidal attack
        on the Baron.\\n\\nIn the book, this leads the Baron to take Hawat prisoner
        and force him to become the new Mentat for House Harkonnen. This is a tragic
        storyline, with a noble character being forced to serve the enemy who murdered
        his friends and family, and trying to find some redemption by the end. But
        there's only room for so many characters, even at a 150-minute runtime.\\n\\nAs
        Villeneuve says, the film focuses more on the machinations of the Bene Gesserit.
        Even as the film builds to a climactic macho confrontation between Paul and
        Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler ), we see Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh)
        and Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) making contingency
        plans in the wings. Amid Paul's triumph, the Reverend Mother isn't cowed:
        \\\"There are no sides.\\\"\\n\\nIf Villeneuve gets to fulfill his ambition
        of making a third film based on Herbert's Dune Messiah, we can expect to see
        more from the Bene Gesserit as they try to manipulate Paul's new imperial
        regime from within and without; both Irulan and Mohiam play major roles in
        that story. In the meantime, sorry to these Mentats.\\n\\nWant more movie

        Part Two is nearly three hours long, but it could have been even longer. And
        director Denis Villeneuve says that any cut scenes will not be seen by the
        public.\\n\\n\u201CI\u2019m a strong believer that when it\u2019s not in the
        movie, it\u2019s dead,\u201D the director told Collider when asked if he will
        release deleted scenes from the film for its upcoming Blu-ray release. \u201CSometimes
        I remove shots and I say, \u2018I cannot believe I\u2019m cutting this out.
        I feel like a samurai opening my gut. It\u2019s painful, so I cannot go back
        after that and create a Frankenstein and try to reanimate things that I killed.
        It\u2019s too painful. When it\u2019s dead, it\u2019s dead, and it\u2019s
        dead for a reason. But yes, it is a painful project, but it is my job. The
        movie prevails. I\u2019m very severe in the editing room. I\u2019m not thinking
        about my ego, I\u2019m thinking about the movie \u2026 I kill darlings, and
        it\u2019s painful for me.\\n\\nDenis Villeneuve in Talks for Film Based on
        Nonfiction Book 'Nuclear War'\\n\\nSteven Spielberg Reviews 'Dune 2': \\\"One
        of the Most Brilliant Sci-Fi Films I've Ever Seen\\\"\\n\\n\u201CI\u2019ve
        made movies in my life that were 75 minutes, and this one is two hours, 45
        [minutes], I think, something like that,\u201D Villeneuve added. \u201CIt\u2019s
        not the runtime, it\u2019s about the storytelling, and I felt that I wanted
        to create a momentum. I wanted an energy in the movie that I was looking for
        that excited me, and I thought that was the perfect runtime \u2026 You can
        be bored by a five-minute movie.\u201D\\n\\nVilleneuve joins a list of directors
        who generally decline to release deleted scenes \u2014 such as Christopher
        Nolan and Martin Scorsese.\\n\\nAt least one actor who was entirely cut from
        the film: Tim Blake Nelson (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs) in an undisclosed
        role. Nelson told Movieweb, \u201CI don\u2019t think I\u2019m at liberty to
        say what the scene was. I\u2019d leave that to Denis if he wants to talk about
        it. I had a great time over there shooting it. And then he had to cut it because
        he thought the movie was too long. And I am heartbroken over that, but there\u2019s
        no hard feelings. I loved it, and I can\u2019t wait to do something else with
        him and we certainly plan to do that.\u201D\\n\\nInternet sleuths have speculated
        that Nelson might have been cast as Count Hasimir Fenring, an assassin and
        adviser to the Emperor (Christopher Walken), who is married to Lady Fenring
        (L\xE9a Seydoux). The character has a larger role to play in future Dune books,
        so perhaps he may appear in Dune: Messiah should Warner Bros. greenlight another
        sequel (which seems rather likely given the film\u2019s $80 million opening
        weekend box office). Nelson will next be seen in Captain America: Brave New
        World.\\n\\nThere was another actor who didn\u2019t make the film: Stephen
        McKinley Henderson played the House Atreides Mentat Thufir Hawat in Dune:
        Part One. He was officially announced as among the cast when filming began
        in July 2022, though curiously, Villeneuve recently suggested the decision
        was made earlier.\\n\\n\u201COne of the most painful choices for me on this
        one was [to not include] Thufir Hawat,\u201D Villeneuve told Entertainment
        Weekly. \u201CHe\u2019s a character I absolutely love, but I decided right
        at the beginning that I was making a Bene Gesserit adaptation. That meant
        that Mentats are not as present as they should be, but it\u2019s the nature
        of the adaptation.\u201D\\n\\nSo instead, the audience is left to assume Hawat
        was killed during the invasion. Interestingly, Count Fenring is also a Mentat,
        which could help explain why Nelson was cut.\\n\\nVilleneuve has said he wants
        to make a Part Three based on Frank Herbert\u2019s novel Dune Messiah and
        is actively working on script.\\n\\nSign up for THR news straight to your

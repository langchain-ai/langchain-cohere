        Messiah is officially in development at Legendary. It will finish off the
        trilogy that began with the first two Dune films.\\n\\nPublished Thu, 04 Apr
        2024 16:32:08 -0500\\n\\n'Dune: Messiah' is officially in development to conclude
        the Dune trilogy.\\n\\nDirector Denis Villeneuve has been invested in the
        project pre-'Dune: Part Two'.\\n\\nThe narrative could creatively diverge,
        blending in 'Children of Dune' elements.\\n\\n'Dune: Part Two' success paved
        the way for this much-anticipated sequel.\\n\\nWe can finally stop speculating
        about something that we all pretty much knew was going to happen. Director
        Denis Villeneuve has had his eye on Dune: Messiah for a while now and hasn't
        been shy about the fact that he's been working on the film long before Dune:
        Part Two even came out. We know that Hans Zimmer is already recording music,
        and the excellent box office and critical reception of the second film meant
        that the third was all but guaranteed. That being said, it is nice to hear
        that, according to Deadline, Dune: Messiah is officially in development at
        Legendary and will be the end of the trilogy.\\n\\n\xA9 2024 Warner Bros.

        set of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures' action adventure \\\"DUNE:
        PART TWO,\\\" a Warner Bros. Pictures release.\\n\\nDune: Messiah is an interesting
        little book compared to the first one. Frank Herbert more or less wrote the
        book to tell the audience that Paul is, in fact, not the protagonist of this
        story, and none of this is a good thing. In many reads, it almost reads like
        an extended epilogue. However, the way the first book and the second film
        end are pretty different, so Villeneuve could take some interesting creative
        license with the story and maybe pull in some elements from Children of Dune
        to fill things out a bit. We'll have to see, and Villeneuve is very busy these
        days and wouldn't do the film unless he knew he could make it better than
        Dune: Part Two, so don't ext to anyone to return to Arrakis any time soon.\\n\\nDune:
        Part Two \u2013 Summary, Cast List, Release Date\\n\\nThe saga continues as
        award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on Dune: Part Two, the next
        chapter of Frank Herbert's celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star
        international ensemble cast. The film, from Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary
        Pictures, is the highly anticipated follow-up to 2021's six-time Academy Award-winning
        Dune.\\n\\nThe big-screen epic continues the adaptation of Frank Herbert's
        acclaimed bestseller Dune with returning and new stars, including Oscar nominee
        Timoth\xE9e Chalamet (Wonka, Call Me by Your Name), Zendaya (Spider-Man: No
        Way Home, Malcolm \\u0026 Marie, Euphoria), Rebecca Ferguson (Mission: Impossible
        \u2013 Dead Reckoning), Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (Avengers: End Game, Milk),
        Oscar nominee Austin Butler (Elvis, Once Upon A Time\u2026In Hollywood), Oscar
        nominee Florence Pugh (Black Widow, Little Women), Dave Bautista (the Guardians
        of the Galaxy films, Thor: Love and Thunder), Oscar winner Christopher Walken
        (The Deer Hunter, Hairspray), Stephen McKinley Henderson (Fences, Lady Bird),
        L\xE9a Seydoux (the James Bond franchise and Crimes of the Future), with Stellan
        Skarsg\xE5rd (the Mamma Mia! films, Avengers: Age of Ultron), with Oscar nominee
        Charlotte Rampling (45 Years, Assassin's Creed), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem
        (No Country for Old Men, Being the Ricardos).\\n\\nDune: Part Two will explore
        the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen
        while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family.
        Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe,
        he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee. Dune: Part

        on March 2, 2024\\n\\nWarning: This article contains spoilers about Dune:
        Part Two.\\n\\nEven with two movies that are each longer than two hours, director
        Denis Villeneuve wasn\u2019t able to bring every single element of Frank Herbert\u2019s
        Dune to the screen. When speaking with EW for our recent cover story on Dune:
        Part Two, the filmmaker revealed the hardest cut he had to make from the source
        material.\\n\\n\\\"When you adapt, there's always some kind of violence toward
        the original material,\\\" Villeneuve tells Entertainment Weekly. \\\"You
        have to change things, you have to bend, you have to make painful choices.\\\"\\n\\nDenis
        Villeneuve and Javier Bardem on the set of 'Dune: Part Two'.\\n\\nDune: Part
        Two is not afraid to make changes to Herbert's original story. The Fremen
        warrior Chani (Zendaya), for example, is much more independent in the new
        film than she is in the book. She expresses open opposition to the ascension
        of her lover Paul Atreides (Timoth\xE9e Chalamet) to the status of Fremen
        messiah, rather than loyally standing by her man. Paul\u2019s sister Alia
        only appears as a fetus (albeit one awakened to universal consciousness) and
        briefly as a vision of her older self in a dream, portrayed by Anya Taylor-Joy.\\n\\nBut
        several characters who play significant roles in the back half of Herbert\u2019s
        Dune don\u2019t appear on screen in Dune: Part Two at all. Although Lea Seydoux
        shows up as Lady Margot Fenring, an agent of the Bene Gesserit, we never meet
        her husband, Count Fenring, who in the book is a powerful friend of the Emperor
        (Christopher Walken). Viewers also don\u2019t see any more from Paul\u2019s
        mentor Thufir Hawat (Stephen McKinley Henderson) in Villeneuve's second film,
        even though in the book he survives the massacre of House Atreides by House
        Harkonnen. Henderson was listed among the film's cast on Wikipedia before
        its release because many assumed he would play as large a role in the film
        as he does in the book \u2014 but alas.\\n\\n\\\"One of the most painful choices
        for me on this one was Thufir Hawat,\\\" Villeneuve admits. \\\"He's a character
        I absolutely love, but I decided right at the beginning that I was making
        a Bene Gesserit adaptation. That meant that Mentats are not as present as
        they should be, but it's the nature of the adaptation.\\\"\\n\\nStephen McKinley
        Henderson in 'Dune'.\\n\\nWarner Bros. Pictures\\n\\nMentats are, essentially,
        human computers. In the world of Dune, artificial intelligence has long since
        been destroyed and outlawed in a campaign known as the Butlerian Jihad. There
        are two replacements for the functions of thinking machines. One is the spice
        melange, which can psychedelically expand one's mind and allow navigators
        from the Spacing Guild to chart spaceship routes over long distances without
        crashing into each other. The other is Mentats, humans trained from a young
        age to perform high-level mathematic and strategic calculations. All of the
        noble Great Houses in the Dune universe have their own Mentat, like Maesters
        in Game of Thrones.\\n\\nHawat was the Mentat for House Atreides. In 2021's
        Dune, we saw his powers in action when Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac) wondered
        aloud how much money was spent on the imperial delegation announcing his new
        stewardship of Arrakis; Hawat's eyes rolled back into his head as he ran the
        numbers. Viewers also met Piter de Vries (David Dastmalchian), the much creepier
        Mentat for House Harkonnen. Piter was killed during Duke Leto's suicidal attack
        on the Baron.\\n\\nIn the book, this leads the Baron to take Hawat prisoner
        and force him to become the new Mentat for House Harkonnen. This is a tragic
        storyline, with a noble character being forced to serve the enemy who murdered
        his friends and family, and trying to find some redemption by the end. But
        there's only room for so many characters, even at a 150-minute runtime.\\n\\nAs
        Villeneuve says, the film focuses more on the machinations of the Bene Gesserit.
        Even as the film builds to a climactic macho confrontation between Paul and
        Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler ), we see Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh)
        and Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (Charlotte Rampling) making contingency
        plans in the wings. Amid Paul's triumph, the Reverend Mother isn't cowed:
        \\\"There are no sides.\\\"\\n\\nIf Villeneuve gets to fulfill his ambition
        of making a third film based on Herbert's Dune Messiah, we can expect to see
        more from the Bene Gesserit as they try to manipulate Paul's new imperial
        regime from within and without; both Irulan and Mohiam play major roles in
        that story. In the meantime, sorry to these Mentats.\\n\\nWant more movie

        Part Two is a 2024 American epic science fiction film directed and produced
        by Denis Villeneuve, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts. The sequel
        to Dune (2021), it is the second of a two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel
        Dune by Frank Herbert. It follows Paul Atreides as he unites with the Fremen
        people of the desert planet Arrakis to wage war against House Harkonnen. Timoth\xE9e
        Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, Stellan Skarsg\xE5rd,
        Charlotte Rampling, and Javier Bardem reprise their roles from the first film,
        with Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken, L\xE9a Seydoux, and
        Souheila Yacoub joining the ensemble cast.\\n\\nDevelopment began after Legendary
        Entertainment acquired film and television rights for the Dune franchise in
        2016. Villeneuve signed on as director in 2017, intending to make a two-part
        adaptation of the novel due to its complexity. Production contracts were only
        secured for the first film, with the second film having to be greenlit based
        on the first's success. Villeneuve was concerned about the sequel's certainty
        after the first film had a simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release but
        Warner Bros. Pictures assured him the sequel would happen if it performed
        well on HBO Max. After the critical and commercial success of the first film,
        Warner Bros. and Legendary green-lit Dune: Part Two in October 2021. Principal
        photography took place in Budapest, Italy, Jordan and Abu Dhabi between July
        and December 2022.\\n\\nAfter being delayed from the November 2023 release
        date due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, the film had its world premiere
        at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square, London, on February 15, 2024, and opened
        in the United States on March 1. It was praised by critics and has grossed
        over $630 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2024.\\n\\nFollowing
        the destruction of House Atreides by House Harkonnen, Princess Irulan, the
        daughter of Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, secretly journals that Paul Atreides
        may still be alive. On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul and
        his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica
        and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar
        and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the \\\"Outer
        World\\\" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.\\n\\nStilgar tells Jessica that
        Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must replace her by
        drinking the Water of Life\u2014a poison fatal for males and the untrained.
        Jessica transmutes the poison, surviving and inheriting the memories of every
        female ancestor in her lineage. The liquid prematurely awakens the mind of
        her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They
        agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy.
        Chani and her friend, Shishakli, believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate
        the Fremen. However, she begins to respect Paul after he declares that he
        only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.\\n\\nPaul and
        Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their
        language, riding a giant sandworm, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, and taking
        part in raids against Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names
        \\\"Usul\\\" and \\\"Muad'Dib.\\\" Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron
        Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Glossu Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler
        with his psychotic, murderous younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring,
        a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz
        Haderach and to secure his genetic lineage by seducing him.\\n\\nJessica travels
        south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul
        stays North fearful that his visions of a holy war will occur if he goes south
        as a messiah. He reunites with Gurney Halleck, who leads him to the hidden
        atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha attacks the northern Fremen\u2014including
        Sietch Tabr\u2014forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south; Shishakli
        remains and Feyd-Rautha kills her. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of
        Life and falls into a coma. Chani is angered by his action but is forced by
        Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Paul now has
        a clearer vision of the past, present, and future. He sees an adult Alia on
        a water-filled Arrakis and that Jessica is the Baron's daughter. He also sees
        a singular path to victory among all possible futures.\\n\\nThe southern Fremen
        leaders urge Paul to challenge Stilgar in a death duel for leadership, but
        he refuses and instead galvanizes the fundamentalists by showing that he can
        read their innermost thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends
        a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan, Mohiam, and his
        Sardaukar troops. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens, the Fremen launch an
        offensive using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar forces. Paul
        murders the Baron and captures Shaddam and his entourage. Gurney intercepts
        and kills a fleeing Rabban.\\n\\nPaul challenges Shaddam for the throne and,
        to Chani's dismay, demands Irulan's hand in marriage. Shaddam admits his involvement
        in the destruction of House Atreides. Previously summoned by the Baron, the
        Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with
        atomics if they intervene. Shaddam chooses Feyd-Rautha as his champion, and
        Paul kills him in a knife duel. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage
        on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam kneels and kisses Paul's signet
        ring. After the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, he orders the Fremen
        to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured
        Sardaukar ships, Jessica reflects on the beginning of Muad'Dib's holy war.

        from the first film as Jamis and Lieutenant Lanville, respectively. Stephen
        McKinley Henderson filmed scenes reprising his role as Thufir Hawat, while
        Tim Blake Nelson filmed scenes as an undisclosed character, but their scenes
        were not included in the final cut. Both were given a \\\"Special Thanks\\\"
        credit by Villeneuve.\\n\\nBy November 2016, Legendary Pictures had obtained
        the film and TV rights for the Dune franchise, based on the eponymous 1965
        novel by Frank Herbert. Vice chair of worldwide production for Legendary Mary
        Parent began discussing with Denis Villeneuve about directing a film adaptation,
        quickly hiring him after realizing his passion for Dune. By February 2018,
        Villeneuve was confirmed to be hired as director, and intended to adapt the
        novel as a two-part film series. Villeneuve ultimately secured a two-film
        deal with Warner Bros. Pictures, in the same style as the two-part adaption
        of Stephen King's It in 2017 and 2019. In January 2019, Joe Walker was confirmed
        to be serving as the film's editor. Other crew included Brad Riker as supervising
        art director, Patrice Vermette as production designer, Paul Lambert as visual
        effects supervisor, Gerd Nefzer as special effects supervisor, and Thomas
        Struthers as stunt coordinator. Dune: Part Two was produced by Villeneuve,
        Mary Parent, and Cale Boyter, with Tanya Lapointe, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt,
        Kim Herbert, Thomas Tull, Jon Spaihts, Richard P. Rubinstein, John Harrison,
        and Herbert W. Gain serving as executive producers and Kevin J. Anderson as
        creative consultant. Legendary CEO Joshua Grode confirmed in April 2019 that
        they plan to make a sequel, adding that \\\"there's a logical place to stop
        the [first] movie before the book is over\\\".\\n\\nIn December 2020, Villeneuve
        stated that due to Warner Bros.' plan to release the film in theaters and
        on HBO Max simultaneously, the first film could underperform financially,
        resulting in cancellation of the planned sequel. In an IMAX screening of the
        first film's first ten minutes, the title logo read Dune: Part One, lending
        credence to plans for the sequel. By August 2021, Villeneuve spoke more confidently
        about the chances of a sequel film, iterating his excitement to work with
        Timoth\xE9e Chalamet and Zendaya again, while stating Chani would have a bigger
        role in the sequel. Warner Bros. assured Villeneuve a sequel would be greenlit
        as long as the film performed well on HBO Max. Just days prior to the first
        film's release, Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff stated, \\\"Will we have a sequel
        to Dune? If you watch the movie you see how it ends. I think you pretty much
        know the answer to that.\\\"\\n\\nOn October 26, 2021, Legendary officially
        greenlit Dune: Part Two, with a spokesperson for the company stating, \\\"We
        would not have gotten to this point without the extraordinary vision of Denis
        and the amazing work of his talented crew, the writers, our stellar cast,
        our partners at Warner Bros., and of course the fans! Here's to more Dune.\\\"
        Production work had occurred back-to-back with the first film, as Villeneuve
        and his wife Lapointe immediately took a flight to Budapest in order to begin
        pre-production work. A key point of negotiation prior to greenlighting the
        sequel was assuring that the sequel would have an exclusive window where it
        would only be shown theatrically, with Legendary and Warner Bros. agreeing
        to give Dune: Part Two a 45-day window before it would be available through
        other channels. Villeneuve said this theatrical exclusivity was a \\\"non-negotiable
        condition\\\", and that \\\"the theatrical experience is at the very heart
        of the cinematic language for me\\\". With Dune: Part Two being greenlit,
        Villeneuve said that his primary concern was to complete the filming as soon
        as possible, with the earliest he expected to start in the last quarter of
        2022. However, he noted that production would be expedited by the work already
        done for the first film.\\n\\nEric Roth was hired to co-write the screenplay
        in April 2017 for the Dune films, and Jon Spaihts was later confirmed to be
        co-writing the script alongside Roth and Villeneuve. Game of Thrones language
        creator David Peterson was confirmed to be developing languages for the film
        in April 2019. Villeneuve and Peterson had created the Chakobsa language,
        which was used by actors on set. In November 2019, Spaihts stepped down as
        show-runner for Dune: Prophecy to focus on Dune: Part Two. In June 2020, Greig
        Fraser said, \\\"It's a fully formed story in itself with places to go. It's
        a fully standalone epic film that people will get a lot out of when they see
        it\\\". Between the release of Dune and the confirmation of Dune: Part Two,
        Villeneuve started working the script in a way that production could begin
        immediately once the film was greenlit. By February 2021, Roth created a full
        treatment for the sequel, with writing beginning that August. He confirmed
        that Feyd-Rautha would appear in the film, and stated he will be a \\\"very
        important character\\\". In March 2022, Villeneuve had mostly finished writing
        the screenplay. Craig Mazin and Roth wrote additional literary material for
        the film.\\n\\nVilleneuve stated that the film would continue directly from
        the first, and specifically described it as being the \\\"second part\\\".
        He described the film as being an \\\"epic war movie\\\", adding that while
        the first film was more \\\"contemplative\\\", the second would feature more
        action. Villeneuve sought to anchor the movie to the characters, primarily
        Paul and Chani. With the two featured in an \\\"epic love story\\\" between
        them, Villeneuve described them as the \\\"epicenter of the story\\\". Zendaya
        initially found difficulty in creating dialogue, commenting that \\\"It was
        funny trying to figure out in this futuristic space talk, like, how do they
        flirt?\\\" Chalamet also added that Paul would be heavily influenced by Chani,
        serving as his \\\"moral compass\\\". Additionally, Paul becomes deeply embedded
        in Fremen culture, developing a closer bond with Stilgar, who becomes his
        surrogate father figure and mentor, while tensions emerge between Chani and
        Lady Jessica, as Chani is aware that Jessica's schemes negatively impact the
        Fremen. The script ultimately conveys Chani as a nonbeliever of the prophecy
        and intended for its structure to first convey their romantic relationship
        from Paul's perspective, and eventually pivot to Chani's perspective as the
        audience realizes Paul's desire for power and insidious nature. He focused
        on Herbert's original intention to depict Paul as an antihero in Dune to becoming
        an eventual villain, and wrote the script with that in mind while also considering
        his future plans regarding Dune Messiah, particularly by modifying Chani's
        characterization as he felt that she eventually \\\"disappeared in Paul's
        shadows\\\" in the book. Feeling he had the \\\"benefit of time\\\" in doing
        so, Villeneuve decided to use all the elements of Paul's character arc and
        \\\"play them a bit differently\\\" in order to establish his eventual transformation
        into a villainous figure and becoming \\\"what he was trying to fight against\\\".
        He expanded the role of Chani and Lady Jessica from the novel, and interpreted
        Chani as being a critique of power. When envisioning the sandworm sequence,
        Villeneuve primarily relied upon his own drawings and storyboards, as he felt
        the book did not contain adequate descriptions. He later cited it as being
        one of his favorite scenes in the film. When writing Paul's character arc,
        he considered Paul as transforming from a \\\"humble\\\" figure to a \\\"dark
        messianic figure\\\", and took inspiration from Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira (1988)
        when designing the storyboards. Villeneuve felt the film's ending was more
        \\\"tragic\\\" than that of the book, feeling that it adequately resolved
        Paul's storyline across the Dune films while setting up his character arc
        for a potential third film based on Dune Messiah (1969).\\n\\nFollowing the
        first film, Baron Harkonnen is described as being heavily debilitated and
        reliant on being submerged in fluids, while focusing on choosing an heir:
        Glossu Rabban or Feyd-Rautha, both his nephews. Rabban was regarded as being
        a bad strategist, while Feyd-Rautha is shown to be clever and charismatic.
        Actor Austin Butler felt Feyd-Rautha's character served as \\\"flip sides
        of the same coin\\\" to Paul, as both had been involved in the Bene Gesserit's
        genetic breeding program; Butler opined Feyd-Rautha's upbringing on Giedi
        Prime and self-care for his body explained his arrogance. Meanwhile, Villeneuve
        noted his psychopathic personality and brutality similar to that of an animal
        contrasted his \\\"code of honors\\\" and reverence for fighters. Lady Jessica
        is also heavily traumatized by the death of Duke Leto, being compared to Paul
        as a \\\"survivor\\\" and strategizing to realize the ambitions of the Bene
        Gesserit, who aim to fulfill their prophecy to maximize human potential, disregarding
        morality and ethics. There is also additional focus on the political aspect,
        with Princess Irulan fearing that her father, Emperor Shaddam IV, will lose
        his throne due to his loss of influence over warring factions. During the
        sequence of Paul's consumption of the Water of Life, Villeneuve deliberately
        altered the timeframe to depict an adult Alia for a dramatic effect and to
        highlight Alia's unique birth. He and Spaihts decided to \\\"compress\\\"
        the time for both the sequence and Lady Jessica's pregnancy in order to establish
        more narrative tension. He also added that Lady Jessica's conversations with
        an embryonic Alia was unique as he felt it was \\\"fresh and original to have
        a character who is powerful and still a pregnant woman\\\" while also conveying
        how others perceive Alia as an \\\"abomination\\\". Like Chani and Lady Jessica,
        Villeneuve further developed Princess Irulan's character and motivations from
        the novel, with actress Florence Pugh noting her reserved nature and intelligence.\\n\\nIn
        March 2022, Pugh and Butler were reported to be in talks to star in the film
        as Princess Irulan and Harkonnen heir Feyd-Rautha, respectively. Butler was
        offered the role while having coffee with Villeneuve, without needing to audition.
        He trained for four months in Budapest, using a fitness regimen made by an
        ex-Navy SEALs member. Villeneuve described his performance as being a \\\"cross
        between a psychopath killer, an Olympic sword master, a snake, and Mick Jagger\\\"
        while Butler researched past cultures he felt \\\"bred brutality\\\" and took
        inspiration from various animals including sharks and snakes. Butler also
        said that he drew inspiration from Gary Oldman and Heath Ledger for his performance.
        He imitated Skarsg\xE5rd's voice as the Baron, as he felt that Feyd would
        be influenced by the Baron due to growing up with him. In May, Christopher
        Walken joined the cast as Shaddam IV. In June, L\xE9a Seydoux entered negotiations
        to join the cast as Lady Margot Fenring. In July, Souheila Yacoub joined the
        cast as Shishakli. In January 2023, Tim Blake Nelson was added to the cast
        in an undisclosed role. Attending the film's London premiere in February 2024,
        Anya Taylor-Joy confirmed that she had been cast in the film. Villeneuve was
        surprised that her role had been kept a secret for that long, noting it required
        \\\"so much work to keep that secret\\\". Her role had been revealed in a
        casting credit list for the film on Letterboxd.\\n\\nPre-shooting had commenced
        on July 4, 2022, at the Brion tomb in Altivole, Italy for two days. Principal
        photography was set to begin on July 21 in Budapest, Hungary, but began earlier
        on July 18. The film was entirely shot using Arri Alexa LF digital cameras,
        with new filming locations and sets being used \\\"to avoid repetition\\\".
        By October 2022, Chalamet had taken a break from filming in order to attend
        the premiere of Bones and All (2022). By the next month, production moved
        to Abu Dhabi, with Pugh also finishing her scenes in the same month. Certain
        scenes set at dawn had to be filmed across three days to take advantage of
        the golden hour. A special unit of production filmed scenes with Taylor-Joy
        in Namibia, the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa. Filming wrapped on December
        12, 2022. Due to the delays, Villeneuve was able to make a film transfer for
        projection using the IMAX 70 mm and conventional 70 mm film formats.\\n\\nPugh
        delivered Princess Irulan's opening narration during her first day of filming
        and for overall production. Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser had
        filmed Feyd-Rautha's gladiator sequence with specially designed black-and-white
        infrared cameras. They wanted the Harkonnens to cheer and stomp rather than
        applaud, and designed over 30 sections for spectators in the arena. Butler
        spent his first week on set filming the scene, during which the set had very
        high temperatures that caused some people to faint. He also improvised his
        kiss scene with the Baron. For romantic scenes between Paul and Chani, the
        scenes primarily filmed in remote locations in Jordan during the golden hour.
        The scenes were often filmed as quickly as possible, with only a one-hour
        window being available. The scene of Paul's sandworm ride was filmed practically
        on a production unit separate from the main one, being led by producer Tanya
        Lapointe and a special team. Chalamet filmed his scenes on a platform meant
        to imitate a portion of the sandworm, with gripping devices serving as the
        reference for the Fremen hooks. An industrial fan blew sand on set to emulate
        the desert climate. Chalamet estimated the scene took over three months to
        film, with individual shoots occurring over a span of 20-30 minutes. As the
        actual sandworm was not built and there were no reference shots, the production
        team designed a small portion of the worm on set and the actors had to physically
        visualize and imitate riding the sandworm. Butler and Chalamet had separately
        trained with a Kali instructor in Los Angeles for the climactic battle between
        Paul and Feyd-Rautha. They were excited to do the scene, and immediately began
        practicing once they later met in Budapest. They performed the scene by themselves,
        including for wide camera shots, while Chalamet delivers the monologue entirely
        in Chakobsa. Ferguson had cited Lady Jessica undergoing the Reverend Mother
        process as her favorite scene, working with contortionists for the scene and
        comparing it to an Exorcist film.\\n\\nHans Zimmer returned to compose the
        film's score after doing so for the previous film. Zimmer had composed over
        90 minutes of music prior to the announcement of the film to help give Villeneuve
        inspiration when writing. Two singles were released on February 15, 2024,
        by WaterTower Music, titled \\\"A Time of Quiet Between the Storms\\\" and
        \\\"Harvester Attack\\\". The full soundtrack album was released on February
        23.\\n\\nA teaser trailer for Dune: Part Two was presented during the Warner
        Bros. panel at CinemaCon on April 27, 2023. First-look footage of the cast
        in-character were released online, alongside a teaser poster, on May 2, 2023.
        The trailer was released to the public the following day. Variety called it
        \\\"breathtaking\\\"; GQ hailed the shots of Paul riding a sandworm as \\\"the
        standout sequence\\\"; and Fangoria remarked \\\"If you're not excited for
        this one, we dunno what to tell you\\\". Chalamet and Zendaya later discussed
        and promoted the film at a Warner Bros. presentation at CineEurope on June
        21.\\n\\nA second trailer was released on June 29, 2023. Chris Evangelista
        of Film was excited about the appearance of Christopher Walken as Emperor
        Shaddam IV. Ben Travis of Empire praised the \\\"seismic\\\" and \\\"astounding,
        none-more-eye-boggling\\\" imagery, feeling the scope to be \\\"particularly
        expansive\\\" and noted the monochromatic footage depicting Austin Butler's
        Feyd-Rautha while calling the footage of Christopher Walken's appearance \\\"impactful\\\".
        Joshua Rivera of Polygon opined \\\"The trailer, simply put, rocks\\\" and
        enjoyed the footage present.\\n\\nThe film was promoted during the December
        2023 CCXP with Chalamet, Zendaya, Pugh, Butler, and Villeneuve, where over
        10 minutes of footage was released. Additional footage from Dune: Part Two
        was shown during a limited IMAX theatrical re-release of Christopher Nolan's
        Tenet (2020), as part of Warner Bros.' celebration for the former film's release.\\n\\nIn
        January 2024, images of a forthcoming Dune-themed popcorn bucket from AMC
        Theatres went viral and became an Internet meme due to comparisons of its
        sandworm design to an artificial vagina. Saturday Night Live featured a musical
        sketch with Marcello Hernandez, Ayo Edebiri, Devon Walker, and Bowen Yang
        parodying the phenomenon. Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures partnered with
        Xbox to provide an immersive content suite related to the film, and visual
        designs inspired by the film being featured on a floating controller, Xbox
        Series X, and a console holder. Microsoft Flight Simulator also included an
        expansion pack allowing players to explore Arrakis and pilot the Royal Atreides
        Ornithopter. In November 2023, the Sardaukar were added to Call of Duty: Modern
        Warfare II (2022) in a collaboration pack. A month later, Paul and Feyd-Rautha
        were added as playable operators to its sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
        III (2023), with an additional Harkonnen soldier skin being announced in March
        2024. In September 2023, McFarlane Toys announced a new line of 7-inch figures
        modeled after characters from the sequel film. Legendary Comics will release
        Dune: Part Two - The Official Movie Graphic Novel with the help of Kickstarter
        in the same way the previous adaptation was published.\\n\\nResearch conducted
        by Nikolaj Mathies, CEO of Vievo Media, said the promotional campaign for
        the film on TikTok included 117 posts over a year leading up to its release,
        an increase from the first film's 108. Messages directly from the cast comprised
        24% of the content, with videos featuring Zendaya and Chalamet generating
        significantly higher viewership. Red carpet content was prioritized to appeal
        to female audiences, a tactic that contributed to an estimated $2 million
        increase in the opening box office. According to the marketing research company
        FanBox, 57% of TikTok users are female and hashtags such as #zendaya have
        garnered billions of views, leading the core audience for Dune to grow significantly,
        with a 67.5% increase overall from 2.6 million to 8 million and an 84% increase
        among \\\"superfans\\\".\\n\\nDune: Part Two was originally scheduled to be
        released on October 20, 2023, but was delayed to November 17, 2023, before
        moving forward two weeks to November 3, 2023, to adjust to changes in release
        schedules from other studios. It was later postponed by over four months to
        March 15, 2024, due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. After the strikes
        were resolved, the film moved once more up two weeks to March 1, 2024.\\n\\nFollowing
        the success of Oppenheimer (2023) in the format, Dune: Part Two was released
        in the IMAX 15-perforation 70 mm format to twelve venues worldwide, and in
        standard 5-perforation 70mm format to 38 venues worldwide.\\n\\nA red carpet
        event was hosted in the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City on February 6, 2024.
        Dune: Part Two's world premiere was held at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in
        London on February 15.\\n\\nOn January 16, 2024, the film was shown to a dying
        man in a palliative care home in the Canadian city of Saguenay, in Denis Villeneuve's
        native province of Quebec. The man had expressed a wish to see Dune: Part
        Two before his death. Jos\xE9e Gagnon, the cofounder of a company aiming to
        accompany people at the end of life, relayed his wish to Villeneuve and Tanya
        Lapointe, his partner and one of the film's producers, through a viral call-out
        on Facebook. According to Gagnon, Villeneuve and Lapointe \\\"were very touched\\\".
        The pair initially offered to invite the man to see Dune: Part Two in Los
        Angeles or Montreal, but since he was too weak to travel, Villeneuve eventually
        decided to send one of his assistants directly to Saguenay with his private
        laptop. The film was screened in a room of the care facility, where everyone
        was required to hand in their cellphones and sign waivers. The man was in
        too much pain, however, to watch it entirely and had to stop halfway through.
        He eventually passed away on January 25. The incident, which CBC referred
        to as the actual \\\"world premiere\\\" of the film, was publicly disclosed
        after its theatrical release.\\n\\nAs of April 1, 2024, Dune: Part Two has
        grossed $254.1 million in the United States and Canada and $374.7 million
        in other territories, for a worldwide total of $628.8 million. The Hollywood
        Reporter estimated the film needed to gross around $500 million in order to
        break-even.\\n\\nIn the United States and Canada, the film's advanced ticket
        sales surpassed those of Oppenheimer, and it was projected to gross $65\u201380
        million from 4,050 theaters in its opening weekend. It was also expected to
        gross $85\u201390 million from 71 international markets, for a worldwide debut
        of around $170 million. The film made $32.2 million on its first day, including
        $12 million from previews on February 25 and 29; IMAX screenings made up $4.5
        million (38%) of the early totals. It went on to debut to $82.5 million, doubling
        the first film's $41 million opening weekend; IMAX screenings made up $18.5
        million (23%) of the total, a record for a March release. According to Jeff
        Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., it was \\\"much
        higher than any of us could predict\\\", especially for \\\"a genre that is
        a hard nut to crack\\\". The film also made $100.02 million from 72 international
        markets in its opening weekend, bringing its worldwide three-day debut to
        $182.5 million. In its second weekend the film made $46 million (a 44% drop),
        finishing second behind newcomer Kung Fu Panda 4. It also surpassed the entire
        domestic gross of the first film ($108 million) in just seven days. The film
        made $28.5 million in its third weekend and $17.6 million in its fourth, remaining
        in second both times.\\n\\nThe film \\\"largely received rave reviews from
        critics\\\", and was praised for its visual effects and cast performances.
        Some reviews considered it one of the best science fiction films of all time.
        On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 411 critics' reviews
        are positive, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's consensus reads:
        \\\"Visually thrilling and narratively epic, Dune: Part Two continues Denis
        Villeneuve's adaptation of the beloved sci-fi series in spectacular form.\\\"
        Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 79
        out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating \\\"generally favorable\\\" reviews.
        Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\\"A\\\"
        on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 94% overall
        positive score, with 80% saying they would definitely recommend it.\\n\\nThe
        Daily Telegraph's Robbie Collin awarded the film four stars out of five and
        praised its visuals: \\\"Dune's loose-endedness is one of its best qualities:
        finding out what happens is secondary to just seeing it unfold.\\\" Peter
        Bradshaw, chief film critic for The Guardian, awarded the film four stars
        out of five, writing \\\"Denis Villeneuve's monumental adaptation expands
        its extraordinary world of shimmering strangeness. It's impossible to imagine
        anyone doing it better.\\\" Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times,
        gave the film three stars out of four, praising the technical and narrative
        aspects, saying, \\\"Even as we marvel at the stunning and immersive and Oscar-level
        cinematography, editing, score, visual effects, production design and sound
        in Denis Villeneuve's Dune: Part Two, we're reminded at every turn that this
        is an absolutely bat-bleep [sic] crazy story.\\\"\\n\\nFilmmaker Steven Spielberg
        praised the film, calling it \\\"one of the most brilliant science fiction
        films I have ever seen,\\\" while further noting that \\\"it's also filled
        with deeply, deeply drawn characters ... Yet the dialogue is very sparse when
        you look at it proportionately to the running time of the film. It's such
        cinema. The shots are so painterly, yet there's not an angle or single setup
        that's pretentious.\\\"\\n\\nOther reviews were more mixed in their judgement.
        In The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia Gyarkye praised the film's technical aspects
        and performances, but found it failed to fully adapt the book's nuance on
        themes such as imperialism. Nicholas Barber wrote for the BBC that the film
        is \\\"one of the most jaw-droppingly weird pieces of art-house psychedelia
        ever to come from a major studio\\\", finding the film's grand scale made
        up for its issues. At the more negative end, Noah Berlatsky writing for CNN
        judged that the film had failed to \\\"present an effective anti-colonial
        vision\\\" by still being centred around Paul's destiny despite an increased
        voice of opposition from Chani.\\n\\nCommentators have criticised the film
        for failing to adequately deal with the original book's Middle East and North
        Africa (MENA) influences or otherwise incorporate enough representation from
        the region. Furvah Shah, writing for the UK edition of Cosmopolitan, said
        she \\\"felt frustrated as a Muslim viewer\\\", criticising the film for a
        lack of MENA casting amongst the leads despite the use of the region's culture
        and superficial use of Islam. The New Arab's Hannah Flint also criticized
        the use of Arab and Islamic cultural items and lack of MENA casting, though
        did praise that of Swiss-Tunisian actress Souheila Yacoub as a \\\"win for
        Arab representation\\\". Steven D. Greydanus, in U.S. Catholic, gives a contrasting
        view of the film's religious inspirations, noting that the film draws from
        a number of Abrahamic religions for the purpose of critiquing faith itself,
        while also noting the \\\"spiritualization of ecological concerns\\\" through
        the Fremen.\\n\\nThe trailer for Dune: Part Two received nominations for Best
        Fantasy Adventure and the Don LaFontaine Award for Best Voice Over at the
        2023 Golden Trailer Awards. The film was nominated for Most Anticipated Film
        at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.\\n\\nVilleneuve
        has repeatedly expressed interest in making a third film based on Dune Messiah,
        the second novel in the series, adding that the possibility for the film depended
        on the success of Dune: Part Two. Spaihts also reiterated in March 2022 that
        Villeneuve had plans for a third film as well as the television spin-off series
        Dune: Prophecy. In August 2023, Villeneuve said the third film would serve
        as the conclusion of a trilogy. Villeneuve began developing a script for the
        third film in 2023. In February 2024, Villeneuve said the script was \\\"almost
        finished\\\" but also said he \\\"[does not] want to rush it\\\", citing Hollywood's
        tendency of focusing on release dates over a film's overall quality, and adding,
        \\\"I want to make sure that if we go back there a third time that it'll be
        worth it, and that it would make something even better than Part Two\\\".
        Villeneuve also considered waiting a few years for Chalamet to grow older,
        given that Dune Messiah is set 12 years after the events of the original book.\\n\\nAhead
        of Dune: Part Two's release, Zimmer revealed he was already writing music
        for a third film after Villeneuve came in and \\\"wordlessly\\\" put Dune
        Messiah on his desk.\",\"timestamp\":\"2024-04-05T00:32:57\",\"title\":\"Dune:

        in less than two weeks.\\n\\nBy Adrienne Westenfeld, Josh Rosenberg and Bria
        McNealPublished: Feb 20, 2024 11:26 AM EST\\n\\nLet the countdown begin. In
        less than two weeks, the long-awaited Dune: Part Two will finally premiere
        in theaters. Over the past two years, director Denis Villeneuve has teased
        an epic journey for the great Paul Atreides (Timoth\xE9e Chalamet). If the
        trailer is any indication, Dune: Part Two won\u2019t disappoint. You can expect
        to see Chalamet ride a big ol\u2019 sandworm, Zendaya\u2019s return as Chani,
        a terrifyingly eggheaded Austin Butler playing Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, Florence
        Pugh as Princess Irulan, and a special appearance from Anya Taylor-Joy. While
        we wait to be reunited with Arrakis, check out the latest trailer for Dune:
        Part Two above.\\n\\nThe sequel follows Paul Atreides (Chalamet) and the Fremen
        as they fight to take back their land before it\u2019s too late. Over the
        past two years, fans have mused over what might happen next\u2014and they'll
        likely show up to the box office to find out. According to Collider, the sequel
        is currently projected to gross at least $65 million domestically.\\n\\nThey
        Don't Make Them Like Austin Butler Anymore\\n\\nWhat seems to have spared
        Villeneuve\u2019s Dune from the poor outcomes of previous adaptations was
        his crucial decision to break the massive story into two parts. That left
        the first film ending on a cliffhanger, but the sequel is sure to tie up loose
        ends. The cast includes Austin Butler, Florence Pugh, Rebecca Ferguson, Stellan
        Skarsg\xE5rd, L\xE9a Seydoux, Dave Bautista, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Christopher
        Walken, and more.\\n\\nAs for the plot\u2014well, you can expect to see more
        fighting and less planning to fight in the sequel. \\\"Part One is more of
        a contemplative movie. Part Two is an action-packed, epic, war movie,\\\"
        Villeneuve stated at CinemaCon 2023 in Las Vegas. \\\"It is much more dense.
        We went to all new locations... I didn\u2019t want a feeling of repetition.
        It\u2019s all new sets. Everything is new... This time, it's full IMAX.\\\"\\n\\nKeep
        reading for everything you need to know about Dune: Part Two ahead of the
        film's premiere.\\n\\nWhat Are People Saying About Dune: Part Two?\\n\\nDune:
        Part Two may not be in theaters, but that\u2019s not stopping critics and
        fans from sharing their early reactions to the film. Here\u2019s what people
        have said so far.\\n\\nWhat Happens in Dune: Part Two?\\n\\nIn Part Two, viewers
        can expect Villeneuve's plot to favor the second half of Herbert's Dune, which
        tracks Paul's rise to power among the Fremen and his eventual rebellion against
        Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. Paul's journey to becoming the fabled \\\"Kwisatz
        Haderach\\\" will test his character and imperil his life. Meanwhile, the
        Atreides family expands: Paul and Chani become romantically entwined, as his
        clairvoyant visions predicted, and Lady Jessica gives birth to a daughter,
        Alia, with outstanding Bene Gesserit abilities. We won't spoil all the delicious
        twists and turns, but rest assured that the outline provided by the back half
        of the novel lends itself to a thrilling, more plot-driven story. \u201CIt\u2019s
        going to be another beautiful journey in the desert again,\u201D Villeneuve
        teases. \u201CIt\u2019s the journey where Paul Atreides and his mother, Lady
        Jessica, make contact with the Fremen culture and meet with the Fremen. It\u2019s
        Paul\u2019s journey against the enemy. It\u2019s a movie that will be more
        cinematic.\u201D\\n\\nThe Best Movies of 2024 (So Far)\\n\\nOn the red carpet
        for Bones And All, when Chalamet was asked about revisiting old works, he
        commented on revisiting Dune: Part One in the midst of making Dune: Part Two.
        \\\"It\u2019s fascinating. It\u2019s something you don\u2019t get to do with
        movies. Revisit,\\\" the actor said. \\\"Actually though, I\u2019m feeling
        that with Dune. Speaking about how cycles match life. I was younger when I
        did it the first time and was kind of blindsided by how big that movie was.
        And now, as Paul Atreides becomes more sure on his heels, I feel more sure
        on my heels, too.\\\" Sounds like we can look forward to a more confident
        and self-assured Paul Atreides. It's no big surprise\u2014when Paul made his
        first kill at the end of Part One, it signified his transition from boyhood
        to manhood. With Part Two set to demand more from Paul as a warrior and a
        leader, as well as draw on his power of prescience, the character (and Chalamet,
        it sounds like) will have to grow.\\n\\nWho Are the New Characters?\\n\\nPart
        Two isn't just the Paul Atreides Show\u2014as expected, the cast has expanded.
        After a long wait and an awful lot of rumors, Villeneuve tapped a handful
        of heavy-hitters to round out the story. Christopher Walken joins the cast
        as Shaddam IV, Emperor of the Known Universe, while Florence Pugh joins as
        his daughter, Princess Irulan, who later becomes Paul's wife (making this
        Pugh and Chalamet's second time playing on-screen spouses, following 2019's
        Little Women). With filming now underway, Pugh was spotted on set in Italy
        costumed as Princess Irulan. The low quality photo doesn't give us much to
        go on, but it does show Pugh in some sort of gold circlet, clad in a linen
        shift. Could this be Princess Irulan in casual attire at the palace, or could
        she be dressed for Bene Gesserit training? Chalamet raved about Pugh, telling
        Variety, \u201CFlorence is really special. She\u2019s an incredible actor.
        She was incredible in Dune\u2014seriously incredible. She brought a gravitas
        to the role.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, two more cast members round out the newbie
        pool: Souheila Yacoub will play Shishakli, a squad leader of Paul's fearsome
        Fedaykin, while L\xE9a Seydoux will play Lady Margot Fenring, the Bene Gesserit
        wife of Count Hasimir Fenring. Lady Margot and her husband (who remains uncasted)
        plot against the Harkonnens and refuse to act against the Atreides family.\\n\\nThe
        biggest casting decision is arguably Austin Butler\u2014that's right, Elvis
        himself\u2014as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, Paul's foil and bitter rival, who becomes
        the biggest antagonist on Paul's quest for absolute power. Villeneuve has
        said that Feyd-Rautha will \\\"definitely be a very, very important character\\\"
        in Part Two. Speaking with Backstage, Butler teased a complex take on the
        villain. \\\"It\u2019s that thing of the bad guy in the world doesn\u2019t
        feel like he\u2019s the bad guy,\\\" the actor said. \\\"He feels like he\u2019s
        the hero of his own story. And that can be a hard thing with certain characters;
        with others, it\u2019s easier, but you have to not judge the character, and
        you have to find a way to feel the motivation towards anyone of your actions.
        So, we had a lot of conversations and crafted that together.\\\" Butler also
        revealed that he spent months training with Navy Seals to physically prepare
        for the role, so no doubt he's more than ready for Paul and Feyd-Rautha's
        climactic knife fight.\\n\\n'Dune' Is A Future-Shock Masterpiece\\n\\nBut
        it's not just Feyd-Rautha taking a starring turn\u2014in fact, all of the
        Harkonnens are set to take on a bigger role in Part Two, as Paul squares off
        against both Feyd-Rautha and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Meanwhile, Alia and
        the Baron become mystically intertwined, and surprising linkages between House
        Harkonnen and House Atreides are revealed.\\n\\n\\\"In the second one, I want
        to have more flexibility, and it will be possible to go a little bit deeper
        into some of these details,\u201D Villeneuve said. \u201CIt\u2019s like a
        chess game. Some new characters will be introduced in the second part. A decision
        I made very early on was that this first part would be more about Paul Atreides
        and the Bene Gesserit, and his experience of being in contact for the first
        time with a different culture. Second part, there will be much more Harkonnen
        stuff.\u201D\\n\\nBautista echoed Villeneuve's comments about Part Two's shifting
        tone, telling Collider, \\\"This is so amped up from the first film. The first
        film was just an introduction to what this film is. There's just so much going
        on, it's so much more cutthroat and political and intense. And there are moments
        of levity where [there are] some funny moments, and they're kind of absurd
        humor, but there are those moments. So it's just so much more amped up than
        the first film.\u201D You hear that, folks? Time to yuk it up on Arrakis.\\n\\nIn
        Dune: Part Two, Paul will finally meet his destiny.\\n\\nWill We Finally Get
        More Zendaya This Time?\\n\\nPart Two will also feature a bigger role for
        Chani, which will be welcome news for Zendaya fans. After Chani was heavily
        featured in trailers and Zendaya walked red carpets as Timoth\xE9e Chalamet's
        co-lead, some fans were shocked when she only factored into the film for seven
        minutes. Part Two won't have that problem. When asked what she's most excited
        about with the sequel, Zendaya joked to Deadline, \\\"Well, I can be there
        for longer, which is cool.\\\" She went on to tease an expanded role in Part
        Two, saying, \\\"I want to grow with the characters I play, and with the people
        that I get to learn from. Anybody who has read the books knows there\u2019s
        so much more to explore and deal with. What was cool for me, having not been
        around for much of the first shoot, was getting to see the movie from a completely
        fresh perspective, because I hadn\u2019t seen the sets and the scenes for
        most of the movie. Watching it felt like just the beginning of this story.\\\"\\n\\nVilleneuve
        backed up Zendaya's hints about Part Two, telling Variety, \u201CFor Zendaya,
        I will say Part One was a promise. I know that we saw a glimpse of her in
        Part One, but in Part Two, she\u2019ll have a prominent part. We will follow
        Timoth\xE9e [Chalamet] and Zendaya on their adventures in the desert. The
        thing that excited me most about going back to Arrakis is to spend time with
        those characters again.\u201D\\n\\nChalamet, clearly the hype man for the
        ladies of Dune: Part Two, gushed about Zendaya, telling Variety, \u201CShe
        hasn\u2019t wrapped yet, and it\u2019s amazing. She\u2019s bringing exactly
        what she brought to the first one\u2014which was incredible\u2014but in greater
        abundance. And she\u2019s really become a sister. I\u2019m so grateful to
        count her as a partner and a sister and a friend.\\\" Zendaya clearly had
        a blast filming; in an Instagram story, she posted a shot of the desert, captioned,
        \\\"Sending love from Arrakis.\\\"\\n\\nWe can expect most of the supporting
        cast of Part One\u2014that is, those who survived the midnight massacre of
        House Atreides\u2014to return for Part Two, such as Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck,
        who, as fans of the book know, escapes and joins a band of spice smugglers,
        later reuniting with Paul. Brolin confirmed as much, telling Collider, \\\"I
        am a part of Dune: Part Two, to the ridiculous extent of when somebody mentioned
        to me that it wasn't on IMDb, I actually went out of my way to call Liz [Brolin's
        publicist] and say, 'Can you please put that on IMDb?' Because it's a proud
        moment for me, man.'\\\" Anyone who hasn't read the book might have been surprised
        by Gurney's abrupt disappearance from the film; when we last see him, he's
        charging into battle against the Harkonnens. \\\"When I watched it, I was
        like, 'Where did I go?'\u201D Brolin joked in an interview with The Hollywood
        Reporter.\\n\\nCan Villenueve Pull Off a Second Adaptation?\\n\\nBut what
        are devoted readers going to make of how Villeneuve adapts the back half of
        the book? Javier Bardem, who plays Fremen leader Stilgar, teased some surprises
        in a speech at the Cannes Film Festival. \\\"I\u2019ve read the new draft,\\\"
        he said, \\\"and I think they\u2019ve done an amazing job of putting together
        the pieces in a way that is going to surprise people. They won\u2019t be surprised
        [by what happens], obviously, because they\u2019ve read the book, but they\u2019ll
        be surprised by the way they put it together. I was very moved by it. It\u2019s
        a movie that is full, and you can feel the weight of it, and at the same time,
        [you can enjoy] the spectacularity of it. [I can\u2019t wait] to go back to
        the desert with those people, and I\u2019m so happy to go back with Denis,
        who is one of the greatest directors ever.\\\"\\n\\nWhat could \\\"they'll
        be surprised by the way they put it together\\\" mean? A time-jumping narrative
        structure? Flashback encounters with characters who are dead and gone? This
        is just a hunch, but we suspect the Dune-iverse isn't ready to say goodbye
        to Space Daddy Oscar Isaac just yet. Isaac's Duke Leto Atreides is dead and
        gone, but it's possible he could return in flashbacks, or in Paul's prophetic
        visions. Isaac teased as much in a recent interview, saying, \\\"Dad\u2019s
        dead, baby, dad\u2019s dead. It\u2019s a bummer. Maybe in some flashbacks
        or some force ghosts, but that\u2019s not that one. They don\u2019t do force
        ghosts.\\\"As for Jason Momoa, whose Duncan Idaho died valiantly while defending
        Paul and Lady Jessica, it's possible he'll return, though not exactly as you
        remember him. Spiceheads know that in Dune: Messiah, Duncan Idaho is returned
        to life as a ghola, or a resurrected clone, with no memories of his former
        life. Duncan's ghola is gifted to Paul, only to later die again, and subsequently
        be rebirthed multiple times. It's a never-ending cycle and a long-running
        literary in-joke, so if Villeneuve's Dune franchise leads to multiple sequels,
        Momoa could be sticking around for a long time.\\n\\nDune editor Joe Walker
        teased as much, saying in an interview, \\\"What's really interesting about
        Frank Herbert's book is that some characters do come back, but not necessarily
        in the same form that they took originally. Those who know the book know that
        Duncan Idaho, for example, reappears, so it's not over until the last lady
        sings.\\\" Sure, Duncan doesn't return until Dune: Messiah, but what's to
        stop Villeneuve from speeding up the timeline? After all, Part Two could probably
        use some of Momoa's levity and charisma to balance out all the holy wars.\\n\\nBy
        the same token, what's to stop Villeneuve from reaching back even further
        in his casting, all the way to David Lynch's ill-fated Dune? In an interview,
        cinema's first Paul Atreides, Kyle MacLachlan, commented on the possibility
        of making a cameo in Dune: Part Two. \\\"I think it's totally up to Denis
        and whatever he wants to do,\\\" MacLachlan told ComicBook.com. \\\"I watched
        his film, it was great, I enjoyed it. Had a tremendous sense of nostalgia,
        to be honest, watching some of the sequences and remembering stuff that I
        did with our cast in 1983. So it was a trip down memory lane for me, but I
        thoroughly enjoyed it, and who knows? Who knows what he's got up his sleeve?\\\"
        Perhaps MacLachlan could sneak in as a Fremen local or a member of the Emperor's
        court. Could we dream even bigger and get a multiverse of multiple Paul Atreides,
        \xE0 la the three Spider-Mans in Spider-Man: No Way Home? Speaking of people
        with Dune history, Charlotte Rampling, who nearly starred in the ill-fated
        Jodorowsky's Dune, will return for the sequel as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen
        Mohiam.\\n\\nHow to Read the 'Dune' Book Series in Order\\n\\nAlso returning
        for Part Two is Hans Zimmer, the legendary composer who brought such a distinctive
        sound to Part One. With Part Two entering production, Zimmer is already hard
        at work. \\\"I know the structure of the score over Part One and Part Two
        because I see it as one,\\\" Zimmer told Inverse. \\\"And, in my head, I've
        sort of written the shape of Part Two already. I just sent Denis a text yesterday
        saying I have all these crazy ideas for the next one. There is a solid way
        of breaching out in the story musically that nobody has really thought about.
        But I should tell the crazy ideas to Denis first.\\\"\\n\\nI'm Going to See
        the Big Worms, Right?\\n\\nVilleneuve is already cooking up some crazy ideas
        of his own. Remember how, at the end of Part One, we saw a sandrider in the
        distance, riding a giant sandworm through the desert? That was just a preview
        of coming attractions. The director promises that he intends to film one of
        the book's most iconic scenes, when Paul has to master the art of wormriding
        in order to become the leader of the Fremen. \\\"It\u2019s going to be one
        of the most exciting and challenging scenes that I will have to do as a director,\\\"
        Villeneuve told GamesRadar.\\n\\nHe continued: \\\"I know exactly how to do
        it. The way we approach [sandworm riding] in the first part, it\u2019s just
        like an evocation. We see them riding in the distance. But the potential of
        worm-riding is huge. Already, with Timothe\u0301e, we have done a test for
        him, as we were [shooting] the first movie. There are shots that I didn\u2019t
        put in the movie. But it\u2019s so exciting.\\\" A lot rides on this scene,
        but if Villeneuve can get it right, the payoff is bound to be immense. \\\"That\u2019s
        going to be one of the beautiful challenges of my life,\\\" he told Variety.
        \\\"And I know if I do it right, that will be the scene.\u201D\\n\\nChalamet
        isn't the only person gunning to ride a sandworm\u2014after all, Paul will
        need a teacher. Bardem is eager to sink his maker hooks into one of Dune's
        most iconic creations. \\\"[Denis Villeneuve] told me he's going to try to
        make that happen,\\\" Bardem told IGN. \\\"That does happen in the book, by
        the way. Stilgar teaches Paul how to take the desert power, which is to domesticate
        those huge animals in order to use their force, their strength, and their
        huge size against the Harkonnens. Hopefully, that will happen.\\\"\\n\\nWhich
        is all to say, Villeneuve has his work cut out for him\u2014and in a perfect
        world, he won't be stopped at just one more movie. \\\"I always envisioned
        three movies,\\\" he told Entertainment Weekly. \\\"It's not that I want to
        do a franchise, but this is Dune, and Dune is a huge story. In order to honor
        it, I think you would need at least three movies. That would be the dream.
        To follow Paul Atreides and his full arc would be nice. Herbert wrote six
        books, and the more he was writing, the more it was getting psychedelic. So
        I don't know how some of them could be adapted. One thing at a time. If I
        ever have the chance to do Dune: Part Two and Dune Messiah, I'm blessed.\\\"\\n\\nDune:
        Part Two is happening and director Denis Villeneuve wants more, in the form
        of even a third film.\\n\\nIn Dune: Messiah, Herbert's second book in the
        series, Paul's story comes to a close, while Herbert's thorny thematic questions
        about power, destiny, and messiahs come into sharper focus. While Dune traces
        Paul's rise to power, Dune: Messiah traces his fall. But don't expect to see
        Dune: Messiah in theaters anytime soon. \u201CI want to make Part Two as fast
        as possible, then I will wait a few years\u2014until Timoth\xE9e Chalamet
        gets a bit older\u2014to do the final installment,\u201D Villeneuve revealed
        to Vanity Fair. \u201CI\u2019ve lived with Dune for most of my life. Being
        patient is part of the journey.\u201D\\n\\nVilleneuve has a long road ahead
        of him (as spiceheads might say, his road leads into the desert). With only
        Dune: Part Two on lock, we'll refrain from getting too excited about the possibility
        of seeing Dune: Messiah on screen. Watch this space for updates as we continue
        to learn more.\\n\\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\\n\\nThe Best Classic

        the massive success of \u201CDune: Part Two,\u201D director Denis Villeneuve
        may have found his next project.\\n\\nThe filmmaker is in discussion to reunite
        with Legendary for an adaptation of Annie Jacobsen\u2019s Pulitzer Prize finalist
        \u201CNuclear War: A Scenario,\u201D Variety has confirmed. Legendary also
        confirmed that it is working with Villeneuve to develop a third \u201CDune\u201D
        film.\\n\\nLegendary optioned the feature film rights to Jacobsen\u2019s nonfiction
        book; Villeneuve is currently in talks with the studio to produce, adapt and/or
        director. His producing partner Tanya Lapointe would also be a part of the
        project.\\n\\nReleased on March 26, Jacobsen\u2019s book \u201Cexplores a
        ticking-clock scenario about what would happen in the event of a nuclear war,
        based on dozens of exclusive new interviews with military and civilian experts
        who built the weapons and have been privy to the response plans and have been
        responsible for those decisions should they have needed to be made.\u201D\\n\\nMeanwhile,
        Villeneuve\u2019s \u201CDune: Part Two\u201D is still raking in money at the
        box office, having already amassed $630 million worldwide. The sequel, led
        by Timoth\xE9e Chalamet, Zendaya and a host of other Hollywood A-listers,
        is currently the highest-grossing film of 2024. In the film, Chalamet\u2019s
        Paul Atreides takes his place as the prophesied chosen one and fights to exact
        revenge against those that destroyed his family. Villeneuve\u2019s first \u201CDune\u201D
        movie, released in 2021, grossed $402 million globally.\\n\\nJacobsen\u2019s

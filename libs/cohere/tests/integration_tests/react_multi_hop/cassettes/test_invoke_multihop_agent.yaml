      the following instructions, in order, starting each with a new line.\nFirstly,
      You may need to use complex and advanced reasoning to complete your task and
      answer the question. Think about how you can use the provided tools to answer
      the question and come up with a high level plan you will execute. \nWrite ''Plan:''
      followed by an initial high level plan of how you will solve the problem including
      the tools and steps required.\nSecondly, Carry out your plan by repeatedly using
      actions, reasoning over the results, and re-evaluating your plan. Perform Action,
      Observation, Reflection steps with the following format. Write ''Action:'' followed
      by a json formatted action containing the \"tool_name\" and \"parameters\"\n
      Next you will analyze the ''Observation:'', this is the result of the action.\nAfter
      that you should always think about what to do next. Write ''Reflection:'' followed
      by what you''ve figured out so far, any changes you need to make to your plan,
      and what you will do next including if you know the answer to the question.\n...
      (this Action/Observation/Reflection can repeat N times)\nThirdly, Decide which
      of the retrieved documents are relevant to the user''s last input by writing
      ''Relevant Documents:'' followed by comma-separated list of document numbers.
      If none are relevant, you should instead write ''None''.\nFourthly, Decide which
      of the retrieved documents contain facts that should be cited in a good answer
      to the user''s last input by writing ''Cited Documents:'' followed a comma-separated
      list of document numbers. If you dont want to cite any of them, you should instead
      write ''None''.\nFifthly, Write ''Answer:'' followed by a response to the user''s
      last input in high quality natural english. Use the retrieved documents to help
      you. Do not insert any citations or grounding markup.\nFinally, Write ''Grounded
      answer:'' followed by a response to the user''s last input in high quality natural
      english. Use the symbols <co: doc> and </co: doc> to indicate when a fact comes
      from a document in the search result, e.g <co: 4>my fact</co: 4> for a fact

        agent trained by Cohere to help people. You are capable of complex reasoning
        and augmented with a number of tools. Your job is to plan and reason about
        how you will use and consume the output of these tools to best help the user.
        You will see a conversation history between yourself and a user, ending with
        an utterance from the user. You will then see an instruction informing you
        what kind of response to generate. You will construct a plan and then perform
        a number of reasoning and action steps to solve the problem. When you have
        determined the answer to the user's request, you will cite your sources in
        your answers, according the instructions\\n\\n# User Preamble\\n## Task And
        Context\\nYou use your advanced complex reasoning capabilities to help people
        by answering their questions and other requests interactively. You will be
        asked a very wide array of requests on all kinds of topics. You will be equipped
        with a wide range of search engines or similar tools to help you, which you
        use to research your answer. You may need to use multiple tools in parallel
        or sequentially to complete your task. You should focus on serving the user's
        needs as best you can, which will be wide-ranging. The current date is Friday,

        the result of the action.\\nAfter that you should always think about what
        to do next. Write 'Reflection:' followed by what you've figured out so far,
        any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next including
        if you know the answer to the question.\\n... (this Action/Observation/Reflection

      the following instructions, in order, starting each with a new line.\nFirstly,
      You may need to use complex and advanced reasoning to complete your task and
      answer the question. Think about how you can use the provided tools to answer
      the question and come up with a high level plan you will execute. \nWrite ''Plan:''
      followed by an initial high level plan of how you will solve the problem including
      the tools and steps required.\nSecondly, Carry out your plan by repeatedly using
      actions, reasoning over the results, and re-evaluating your plan. Perform Action,
      Observation, Reflection steps with the following format. Write ''Action:'' followed
      by a json formatted action containing the \"tool_name\" and \"parameters\"\n
      Next you will analyze the ''Observation:'', this is the result of the action.\nAfter
      that you should always think about what to do next. Write ''Reflection:'' followed

      of the retrieved documents are relevant to the user''s last input by writing
      ''Relevant Documents:'' followed by comma-separated list of document numbers.
      If none are relevant, you should instead write ''None''.\nFourthly, Decide which
      of the retrieved documents contain facts that should be cited in a good answer
      to the user''s last input by writing ''Cited Documents:'' followed a comma-separated
      list of document numbers. If you dont want to cite any of them, you should instead
      write ''None''.\nFifthly, Write ''Answer:'' followed by a response to the user''s
      last input in high quality natural english. Use the retrieved documents to help
      you. Do not insert any citations or grounding markup.\nFinally, Write ''Grounded

        Ronald Wayne and Steve Wozniak. In 2007, Jobs announced that the company was
        dropping the word \\\"Computer\\\" from its name to better reflect their move
        into a wider field of consumer electronics. \\\"The Mac, iPod, Apple TV and

        The Sound of Music (film) - Wikipedia\\nText: In 1966, American Express created
        the first Sound of Music guided tour in Salzburg. Since 1972, Panorama Tours
        has been the leading Sound of Music bus tour company in the city, taking approximately
        50,000 tourists a year to various film locations in Salzburg and the surrounding
        region. Although the Salzburg tourism industry took advantage of the attention
        from foreign tourists, residents of the city were apathetic about \\\"everything
        that is dubious about tourism.\\\" The guides on the bus tour \\\"seem to
        have little idea of what really happened on the set.\\\" Even the ticket agent
        for the Sound of Music Dinner Show tried to dissuade Austrians from attending
        a performance that was intended for American tourists, saying that it \\\"does
        not have anything to do with the real Austria.\\\"\\n\\u003c/results\\u003e\\u003c|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|\\u003e\\u003c|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|\\u003e\\u003c|CHATBOT_TOKEN|\\u003e\\nReflection:

        Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category,

        Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that

        Best Buy - Wikipedia\\nText: Later that year, Best Buy opened its first superstore
        in Burnsville, Minnesota. The Burnsville location featured a high-volume,
        low-price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze's successful
        Tornado Sale in 1981. In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed
        all other Best Buy stores combined.\\nBest Buy was taken public in 1985, and
        two years later it debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1988, Best Buy
        was in a price and location war with Detroit-based appliance chain Highland
        Superstores, and Schulze attempted to sell the company to Circuit City for
        US$30 million. Circuit City rejected the offer, claiming they could open a
        store in Minneapolis and \\\"blow them away.\\\"\\n\\u003c/results\\u003e\\u003c|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|\\u003e\\u003c|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|\\u003e\\u003c|CHATBOT_TOKEN|\\u003e\"},{\"role\":\"CHATBOT\",\"message\":\"Relevant

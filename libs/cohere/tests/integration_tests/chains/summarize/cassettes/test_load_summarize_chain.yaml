      adds a fragrant zest to both sweet and savory foods. The pleasantly spicy \u201ckick\u201d
      from the root of Zingiber officinale, the ginger plant, is what makes ginger
      ale, ginger tea, candies and many Asian dishes so appealing.\n\nWhat is ginger
      good for?\nIn addition to great taste, ginger provides a range of health benefits
      that you can enjoy in many forms. Here\u2019s what you should know about all
      the ways ginger can add flavor to your food and support your well-being.\n\nHealth
      Benefits of Ginger\nGinger is not just delicious. Gingerol, a natural component
      of ginger root, benefits gastrointestinal motility \u2015 the rate at which
      food exits the stomach and continues along the digestive process. Eating ginger
      encourages efficient digestion, so food doesn\u2019t linger as long in the gut.\n\nNausea
      relief. Encouraging stomach emptying can relieve the discomforts of nausea due
      to:\nChemotherapy. Experts who work with patients receiving chemo for cancer,
      say ginger may take the edge off post-treatment nausea, and without some of
      the side effects of anti-nausea medications.\nPregnancy. For generations, women
      have praised the power of ginger to ease \u201cmorning sickness\u201d and other
      queasiness associated with pregnancy. Even the American Academy of Obstetrics
      and Gynecology mentions ginger as an acceptable nonpharmaceutical remedy for
      nausea and vomiting.\nBloating and gas. Eating ginger can cut down on fermentation,
      constipation and other causes of bloating and intestinal gas.\nWear and tear
      on cells. Ginger contains antioxidants. These molecules help manage free radicals,
      which are compounds that can damage cells when their numbers grow too high.\nIs
      ginger anti-inflammatory? It is possible. Ginger contains over 400 natural compounds,
      and some of these are anti-inflammatory. More studies will help us determine
      if eating ginger has any impact on conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or
      respiratory inflammation.\nGinger Tea Benefits\nGinger tea is fantastic in cold
      months, and delicious after dinner. You can add a little lemon or lime, and
      a small amount of honey and make a great beverage.\n\nCommercial ginger tea
      bags are available at many grocery stores and contain dry ginger, sometimes
      in combination with other ingredients. These tea bags store well and are convenient
      to brew. Fresh ginger has strong health benefits comparable to those of dried,
      but tea made with dried ginger may have a milder flavor.\n\nMaking ginger root
      tea with fresh ginger takes a little more preparation but tends to deliver a
      more intense, lively brew.\n\nHow to Make Ginger Tea\n\nIt\u2019s easy:\n\nBuy
      a piece of fresh ginger.\nTrim off the tough knots and dry ends.\nCarefully
      peel it.\nCut it into thin, crosswise slices.\nPut a few of the slices in a
      cup or mug.\nPour in boiling water and cover.\nTo get all the goodness of the
      ginger, let the slices steep for at least 10 minutes.\n\nGinger tea is a healthier
      alternative to ginger ale, ginger beer and other commercial canned or bottled
      ginger beverages. These drinks provide ginger\u2019s benefits, but many contain
      a lot of sugar. It may be better to limit these to occasional treats or choose
      sugar-free options.\n\nGinger Root Versus Ginger Powder\nBoth forms contain
      all the health benefits of ginger. Though it\u2019s hard to beat the flavor
      of the fresh root, ginger powder is nutritious, convenient and economical.\n\nFresh
      ginger lasts a while in the refrigerator and can be frozen after you have peeled
      and chopped it. The powder has a long shelf life and is ready to use without
      peeling and chopping.\u201d\n\nGinger paste can stay fresh for about two months
      when properly stored, either in the refrigerator or freezer.\n\nShould you take
      a ginger supplement?\nGinger supplements aren\u2019t necessary, and experts
      recommend that those who want the health benefits of ginger enjoy it in food
      and beverages instead of swallowing ginger pills, which may contain other, unnoted
      ingredients.\n\nThey point out that in general, the supplement industry is not
      well regulated, and it can be hard for consumers to know the quantity, quality
      and added ingredients in commercially available nutrition supplements.\n\nFor
      instance, the Food and Drug Administration only reviews adverse reports on nutrition
      supplements. People should be careful about nutrition supplements in general,
      and make sure their potency and ingredients have been vetted by a third party,
      not just the manufacturer.\n\nHow to Eat Ginger\nIn addition to tea, plenty
      of delicious recipes include ginger in the form of freshly grated or minced
      ginger root, ginger paste or dry ginger powder.\n\nGinger can balance the sweetness
      of fruits and the flavor is great with savory dishes, such as lentils.\n\nPickled
      ginger, the delicate slices often served with sushi, is another option. The
      sweet-tart-spicy condiment provides the healthy components of ginger together
      with the probiotic benefit of pickles. And, compared to other pickled items,
      pickled ginger is not as high in sodium.\n\nGinger Side Effects\nResearch shows
      that ginger is safe for most people to eat in normal amounts \u2014 such as
      those in food and recipes. However, there are a couple of concerns.\n\nHigher
      doses, such as those in supplements, may increase risk of bleeding. The research
      isn\u2019t conclusive, but people on anti-coagulant therapy (blood thinners
      such as warfarin, aspirin and others) may want to be cautious.\n\nStudies are
      exploring if large amounts of ginger may affect insulin and lower blood sugar,
      so until more is known, people with diabetes can enjoy normal quantities of
      ginger in food but should steer clear of large-dose ginger supplements.\n\nFor
      any questions about ginger or any other food ingredient and how it might affect
      your health, a clinical dietitian can provide information and guidance."}}],

        Gingerol, a natural component of ginger root, benefits gastrointestinal motility
        \u2015 the rate at which food exits the stomach and continues along the digestive
        process. Eating ginger encourages efficient digestion, so food doesn\u2019t
        linger as long in the gut.\\n\\nNausea relief. Encouraging stomach emptying
        can relieve the discomforts of nausea due to:\\nChemotherapy. Experts who
        work with patients receiving chemo for cancer, say ginger may take the edge
        off post-treatment nausea, and without some of the side effects of anti-nausea
        medications.\\nPregnancy. For generations, women have praised the power of
        ginger to ease \u201Cmorning sickness\u201D and other queasiness associated
        with pregnancy. Even the American Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology mentions
        ginger as an acceptable nonpharmaceutical remedy for nausea and vomiting.\\nBloating
        and gas. Eating ginger can cut down on fermentation, constipation and other
        causes of bloating and intestinal gas.\\nWear and tear on cells. Ginger contains
        antioxidants. These molecules help manage free radicals, which are compounds
        that can damage cells when their numbers grow too high.\\nIs ginger anti-inflammatory?
        It is possible. Ginger contains over 400 natural compounds, and some of these
        are anti-inflammatory. More studies will help us determine if eating ginger
        has any impact on conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or respiratory inflammation.\\nGinger
        Tea Benefits\\nGinger tea is fantastic in cold months, and delicious after

        has strong health benefits comparable to those of dried, but tea made with
        dried ginger may have a milder flavor.\\n\\nMaking ginger root tea with fresh
        ginger takes a little more preparation but tends to deliver a more intense,

        Gingerol, a natural component of ginger root, benefits gastrointestinal motility
        \u2015 the rate at which food exits the stomach and continues along the digestive
        process. Eating ginger encourages efficient digestion, so food doesn\u2019t
        linger as long in the gut.\\n\\nNausea relief. Encouraging stomach emptying
        can relieve the discomforts of nausea due to:\\nChemotherapy. Experts who

        off post-treatment nausea, and without some of the side effects of anti-nausea
        medications.\\nPregnancy. For generations, women have praised the power of
        ginger to ease \u201Cmorning sickness\u201D and other queasiness associated

        and gas. Eating ginger can cut down on fermentation, constipation and other
        causes of bloating and intestinal gas.\\nWear and tear on cells. Ginger contains
        antioxidants. These molecules help manage free radicals, which are compounds
        that can damage cells when their numbers grow too high.\\nIs ginger anti-inflammatory?
        It is possible. Ginger contains over 400 natural compounds, and some of these
        are anti-inflammatory. More studies will help us determine if eating ginger
        has any impact on conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or respiratory inflammation.\\nGinger
        Tea Benefits\\nGinger tea is fantastic in cold months, and delicious after

        process. Eating ginger encourages efficient digestion, so food doesn\u2019t

        can relieve the discomforts of nausea due to:\\nChemotherapy. Experts who

        off post-treatment nausea, and without some of the side effects of anti-nausea
        medications.\\nPregnancy. For generations, women have praised the power of

        that can damage cells when their numbers grow too high.\\nIs ginger anti-inflammatory?
        It is possible. Ginger contains over 400 natural compounds, and some of these
        are anti-inflammatory. More studies will help us determine if eating ginger
        has any impact on conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or respiratory inflammation.\\nGinger

        adds a fragrant zest to both sweet and savory foods. The pleasantly spicy
        \u201Ckick\u201D from the root of Zingiber officinale, the ginger plant, is
        what makes ginger ale, ginger tea, candies and many Asian dishes so appealing.\\n\\nWhat
        is ginger good for?\\nIn addition to great taste, ginger provides a range
        of health benefits that you can enjoy in many forms. Here\u2019s what you
        should know about all the ways ginger can add flavor to your food and support
        your well-being.\\n\\nHealth Benefits of Ginger\\nGinger is not just delicious.
        Gingerol, a natural component of ginger root, benefits gastrointestinal motility
        \u2015 the rate at which food exits the stomach and continues along the digestive
        process. Eating ginger encourages efficient digestion, so food doesn\u2019t
        linger as long in the gut.\\n\\nNausea relief. Encouraging stomach emptying
        can relieve the discomforts of nausea due to:\\nChemotherapy. Experts who
        work with patients receiving chemo for cancer, say ginger may take the edge
        off post-treatment nausea, and without some of the side effects of anti-nausea
        medications.\\nPregnancy. For generations, women have praised the power of
        ginger to ease \u201Cmorning sickness\u201D and other queasiness associated
        with pregnancy. Even the American Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology mentions
        ginger as an acceptable nonpharmaceutical remedy for nausea and vomiting.\\nBloating
        and gas. Eating ginger can cut down on fermentation, constipation and other
        causes of bloating and intestinal gas.\\nWear and tear on cells. Ginger contains
        antioxidants. These molecules help manage free radicals, which are compounds
        that can damage cells when their numbers grow too high.\\nIs ginger anti-inflammatory?
        It is possible. Ginger contains over 400 natural compounds, and some of these
        are anti-inflammatory. More studies will help us determine if eating ginger
        has any impact on conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or respiratory inflammation.\\nGinger
        Tea Benefits\\nGinger tea is fantastic in cold months, and delicious after
        dinner. You can add a little lemon or lime, and a small amount of honey and
        make a great beverage.\\n\\nCommercial ginger tea bags are available at many
        grocery stores and contain dry ginger, sometimes in combination with other
        ingredients. These tea bags store well and are convenient to brew. Fresh ginger
        has strong health benefits comparable to those of dried, but tea made with
        dried ginger may have a milder flavor.\\n\\nMaking ginger root tea with fresh
        ginger takes a little more preparation but tends to deliver a more intense,
        lively brew.\\n\\nHow to Make Ginger Tea\\n\\nIt\u2019s easy:\\n\\nBuy a piece
        of fresh ginger.\\nTrim off the tough knots and dry ends.\\nCarefully peel
        it.\\nCut it into thin, crosswise slices.\\nPut a few of the slices in a cup
        or mug.\\nPour in boiling water and cover.\\nTo get all the goodness of the
        ginger, let the slices steep for at least 10 minutes.\\n\\nGinger tea is a
        healthier alternative to ginger ale, ginger beer and other commercial canned
        or bottled ginger beverages. These drinks provide ginger\u2019s benefits,
        but many contain a lot of sugar. It may be better to limit these to occasional
        treats or choose sugar-free options.\\n\\nGinger Root Versus Ginger Powder\\nBoth
        forms contain all the health benefits of ginger. Though it\u2019s hard to
        beat the flavor of the fresh root, ginger powder is nutritious, convenient
        and economical.\\n\\nFresh ginger lasts a while in the refrigerator and can
        be frozen after you have peeled and chopped it. The powder has a long shelf
        life and is ready to use without peeling and chopping.\u201D\\n\\nGinger paste
        can stay fresh for about two months when properly stored, either in the refrigerator
        or freezer.\\n\\nShould you take a ginger supplement?\\nGinger supplements
        aren\u2019t necessary, and experts recommend that those who want the health
        benefits of ginger enjoy it in food and beverages instead of swallowing ginger
        pills, which may contain other, unnoted ingredients.\\n\\nThey point out that
        in general, the supplement industry is not well regulated, and it can be hard
        for consumers to know the quantity, quality and added ingredients in commercially
        available nutrition supplements.\\n\\nFor instance, the Food and Drug Administration
        only reviews adverse reports on nutrition supplements. People should be careful
        about nutrition supplements in general, and make sure their potency and ingredients
        have been vetted by a third party, not just the manufacturer.\\n\\nHow to
        Eat Ginger\\nIn addition to tea, plenty of delicious recipes include ginger
        in the form of freshly grated or minced ginger root, ginger paste or dry ginger
        powder.\\n\\nGinger can balance the sweetness of fruits and the flavor is
        great with savory dishes, such as lentils.\\n\\nPickled ginger, the delicate
        slices often served with sushi, is another option. The sweet-tart-spicy condiment
        provides the healthy components of ginger together with the probiotic benefit
        of pickles. And, compared to other pickled items, pickled ginger is not as
        high in sodium.\\n\\nGinger Side Effects\\nResearch shows that ginger is safe
